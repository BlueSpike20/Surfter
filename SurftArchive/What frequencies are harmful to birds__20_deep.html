On the internet, there is often a fine line between a healthy skepticism of new technologies and blatant misinformation. The recent claim that the radio waves from 5G cellular communication towers are causing mass bird die-offs is a perfect example of just how thin that line can be—and how quickly falsehoods can spread across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and even in the comments of Audubon magazine's stories.  The origin of this claim is as head-spinning as it is instructive, so let's untangle the knot: Does 5G really kill birds, and if not, why are so many people shouting about it online? The first part of this saga is fairly straightforward: No, 5G—the fifth generation of our mobile cellular network—does not kill birds. “Radio wave emissions above 10 MHz from radio transmission antennas (including cell telephone towers) are not known to harm birds,” says Joe Kirschvink, a biophysicist at the California Institute of Technology who specializes in magnetics, in an email.  Krischvink isn’t just an expert on such matters—he was also involved in a related study that has proven prescient. In 2014, Kirschvink, at the same time as another group of biologists in Germany, found that low-level magnetic radiation, such as AM radio waves, could interfere with migratory birds' ability to orient themselves using the Earth's magnetic field. Although the researchers found that the birds were still able to compensate, they proposed restricting the use of the AM frequency band.  Aware of how this research and the resulting proposal might be interpreted by the general public, Kirschvink issued a strong disclaimer in his study: “Modern-day charlatans will undoubtedly seize on this study as an argument for banning the use of mobile phones, despite the different frequency bands involved,” he wrote.  Despite Kirschvink's clear warning, the claims that cellular radio waves kill birds spread nonetheless. The blame for that, however, doesn't fall on Kirschvink and his peers, but rather one “UFO researcher” posting on Facebook.  The "5G kills birds" phenomenon was started by John Kuhles, who according to the fact-checking site Snopes, “runs several anti-5G conspiracy websites and social media pages.” In a Facebook post last year, Kuhles claimed that a recent mass die-off of European Starlings in the Netherlands was caused by a 5G antenna test. Despite the fact that the local municipality never named a cause for the die-off, and the fact that the test Kuhles cites happened months before the die-off occurred, other Facebook pages and health blogs nonetheless picked up the post.  Things got weirder and even more obfuscated when Indian sci-fi blockbuster 2.0, currently the highest-budgeted Tamil-language film ever made, hit cinemas just days later. Apart from being a parable about how technology is ruining our lives, 2.0 specifically depicts electromagnetic radiation from cell towers wiping out bird populations, validating Kuhles' crackpot theory. “Following the release of ‘2.0’, which revolves around a plot depicting harmful effects of EMF radiation on birds, Indian news organisations, mostly Tamil media, published stories on the movie by adding the ‘birds died in The Netherlands due to 5G’ bit,” reported Indian fact-checking outlet Alt News.   Of course, it didn't stop there. Fans of 2.0 then found a 2012 YouTube video in which University of Southern California professor Travis Longcore discusses his study finding that communication towers kill 6.8 million birds annually. Dozens of comments on the video either cite the movie directly, or mention that 2.0's director, S. Shankar, “sent them here." Contrary to 2.0's plot, however, Longcore's research attributed these bird deaths to the disorienting lights used on communication towers, not the electromagnetic radiation they emit.  “People have observed for a very long time that nocturnally migrating birds are attracted to lights at night and it's exacerbated during periods of bad weather,” he told NPR in 2012. “It leaves them circling these towers that they encounter and running into either the guide wires on the towers, each other, ending up on the ground and taken by predators.” Further fueling the 5G flames is a general anxiety around electromagnetic radiation that has been on the rise for the past two decades. Not unlike the claims that 5G kills birds, these fears are also unfounded, stemming from a misinterpretation of a single chart in a 2000 report on the potential health impacts of installing WiFi networks in Florida's Broward County Public Schools, the New York Times reported earlier this year.  Consulting with the school district, physicist Bill Curry cited a chart showing that brain tissue absorbs more radiation as radio frequency increases, thus concluding that WiFi signals, operating in the Ghz spectrum would be hazardous. He was wrong. According to the Times, as radio frequencies increase, our skin blocks them out, making radio waves safer as they increase in frequency (to a certain point). Unfortunately, no one caught Curry's error. “Over the years, Dr. Curry’s warning spread far, resonating with educators, consumers and entire cities as the frequencies of cellphones, cell towers and wireless local networks rose,” the Times reports. “To no small degree, the blossoming anxiety over the professed health risks of 5G technology can be traced to a single scientist and a single chart.” Taken together, it’s a strange and worrisome sequence of events that leads us to 5G being blamed for bird die-offs, but it’s also typical of how misinformation spreads on the internet: an urgent headline, backed by a series of half-truths and misinterpretations, validated by popular culture, and amplified and laundered repeatedly through social media posts.  Fortunately, unlike many other conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns ricocheting around the web, this one doesn’t pose direct harm to anyone or anything. But how the 5G myth and others like it can still cause damage is by distracting people from the many real and urgent threats facing birds and the environment.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: For birds, hearing is second in importance only to vision for monitoring the world around them.  Avian hearing is most sensitive to sounds from about 1 to 4 kHz, although they can hear higher and lower frequencies.  No species of bird has shown sensitivity to ultrasonic frequencies (>20 kHz).  Sensitivity to frequencies below 20 Hz (infrasound) has not received much attention; however, pigeons and a few other species have shown behavioral and physiological responses to these low frequencies.  In general, frequency discrimination in birds is only about one-half or one-third as good it is for humans within the 1 - 4 kHz range.  A problem that birds suffer that is similar to humans is damage to the auditory receptors (hair cells) from loud noises.  The sound intensity that produces damage and the amount of damage produced differs depending on the species.  Birds residing in the active areas of airports might be constantly subjected to sound pressure levels that damage their hearing.  Thus, to effectively disperse birds using sound, auditory alerts must be at frequencies that can be detected by the damaged auditory receptors.  Although some if not all species of birds have the ability to repair damaged hair cells, continued exposure to loud noises would prevent recovery of their hearing.  In this paper I review what is known about avian hearing and compare that to the operational characteristics (frequencies, intensities, duration) of techniques and devices to disperse birds.

The electromagnetic radiations and its impacts on bird diversity in India. Int J Avian & Wildlife Biol. 2020;5(1):5-7.  DOI: 10.15406/ijawb.2020.05.00166  Download PDF Cellular  phones are essential to our lives and so are the cellular phone base stations.  They are not simply free standing towers but a balloon of invisible  electromagnetic field with radiations that continue to threaten life around them,  specifically of the birds. This article explores the various published  scientific studies of the effects that electromagnetic radiations produce on  various bird species in India. Relevant information was collected from  different peer reviewed publications on how the electromagnetic radiations have  been impacting the bird species. Research results from the available studies  are presented and discussed. The limited number of observations and studies  endorse the negative impacts the electromagnetic radiations carry for the  various bird species in the country. Overall, there is a decline in the  diversity of the bird species. Therefore, it becomes important to pay  considerable attention to the observed patterns and opt for a sustainable  development approach for the protection of bird species.  Electromagnetic field and radiations that are invisible to human eye are omnipresent. There are several natural and anthropogenic sources that generate electromagnetic field in the surrounding air like television towers, radio towers and cell phone towers. Amongst the various anthropogenic sources, cellular mobile base stations are the major contributors to the electromagnetic field and radiations in the immediate environment. Since the introduction of wireless technology, the spread of electromagnetic field has increased massively in the surrounding air. Before the cell phones came into existence, electromagnetic radiation emission was sporadic from a few radio or television transmitters only. The invent and spread of cell phones to almost every individual in every home around the world has massively increased the amount of unseen electromagnetic radiations into the atmosphere.1 It must be noted here that the radio/television transmitters transmit a weak radiofrequency (above 10 MHz) field while all the electrical appliances transmit a low frequency (upto 300 Hz) electromagnetic field or intermediate frequency (300 Hz- 10 MHz) electromagnetic field (Figure 1).On the other hand, cellular phones and the mobile base stations transmit a strong electromagnetic field. Cell tower antennas with CDMA technology transmit electromagnetic field and radiations in the frequency range of 869-894 MHz, whereas the cell phone tower antennas with GSM 900 and GSM 1800 technology, transmit electromagnetic field with a frequency range of 935-960 MHz and 1810-1880 MHz. respectively.2 It is noteworthy here that the strength of electromagnetic field and radiations is maximum close to the towers, which decreases with the increase in distance from these towers.3 Figure 1 A range of frequencies (the spectrum) of electromagnetic radiation and their respective wavelengths.  Radiation from cellular mobile base stations is almost identical to that from mobile phones of the same system (GSM 900 or 1800), except that it is simply more powerful. GSM 900 mobile phones emit radiations with a frequency between 890 and 915 MHz, while base stations emit radiations between 935 and 960 MHz.4 Overall, stronger the field, greater is the undesirable impact of the electromagnetic field on life.3,5 With mobile phones becoming necessary tool in the lives of 7 billion people on the earth, it poses a serious threat to all variety of life forms from the exposure to manmade electromagnetic field and radiations. The main objective of this review is to study a pattern of impacts the electromagnetic radiations have on various bird species in India. This article mainly compiles the published work that studies the impacts of anthropogenic electromagnetic field and radiations on the avian life in one of the most populated country of India. Several countries have observed a reduction in bird diversity coinciding with the proliferation of Cellular Mobile Base stations (GSM 900 or 1800).1,6 The most prominent example of this impact comes from the UK where a huge decline in several species of urban birds was observed, including the sparrows. The sparrow population in the country declined from 24 million to 14 million birds in the period of 30 years.2 An abrupt decline with 75% descent occurred between 1994 and 2002 that coincided with the rollout of mobile technology in the country. Similar scenario has been observed in Valladolid, Spain, where a reduction in species diversity in birds and breeding couples occurred since several cellular phone base stations got installed between 1997 to 2007.1 Out of a total 14 bird species found in the city, three species completely disappeared during this time period, while four showed a decline in their populations with seven others in stable state. Overall, the bird population in the city decreased. Similarly, the productivity of White stork (Ciconiaciconia) in nests located far away to cellular phone Base stations was observed to be higher than in the nests located within 200m of antennaein Spain.7 In Belgium, many sparrows disappeared recently.5 There was found a strong correlation between spatial variation in number of house sparrows with the strength of electromagnetic field. Indian scenario is no different than the observed in various parts of the world. India is very well known for its biodiversity. It is one of the seventeen mega diverse countries in the world with only 2.4 % of the world’s land area that accommodates about 7-8 % of overall species found around the world.8 The biological richness of the country is evident from the fact that it accounts 45,000 species of plants and 91,000 species of animals that represent almost 7% and 6.5% of world’s flora and fauna respectively. Out of a total of 10,000 species of birds found all over the world, almost 1230 species are found in India only. Overall, almost 13% of the world’s bird species found in India are under threat for various reasons: climate change, pollution and strong electromagnetic fields. Like in different parts of the world, Indian cities have observed a decline in the overall abundance in birds in various parts of the country.2,9,10 Bird population and density declined closer to the cellular phone base stations. This could be attributed to reduced reproductive success in the birds. In the state of Punjab, birds of different species were observed to have lowered breeding success close to cell phone base stations. Similar observations were made in the town ofBijapurin the state of Uttar Pradesh. A reduction in bird population was recorded in ten species of the birds commonly found in the city.10 Scenario was no different in the central parts of the country. In the town Drug in the state of Madhya Pradesh, population density in 13 species of birds declined where 27 cell phone base stations were installed.11 In Southern Parts of the country in Chennai, four of the 200-odd Chennai birds; house sparrow (Passer domesticus), red whiskered bulbul (Pycnonotusjocosus), brahmini kite (Haliasturindus) and spotted dove (Streptopeliachinensis) have virtually disappeared. These are birds which have always been around. Now they are nowhere to be seen. Disappearance of house sparrows has been reported from different parts of the country. Birds are known to be sensitive to magnetic radiation. Increasing number of cell phone towers in cities apparently are bringing down bird population. The microwaves (300 MHz to 300 GHz) emitted by cell phone towers and handsets has been found to be responsible for damaging eggs and embryos of sparrows. The most probable cause of the decline in overall population in birds owing to mobile and cell phone base stations is the effect on reproductive success in birds.3 The electromagnetic field adversely impacts the reproductive success of kestrels (Falco sparverius). The hatching success is reduced in the birds though the fertility and fledging success is increased.12 The current scientific evidence indicates that prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields at the levels encountered in the environment, may affect the immune system function. Pulsed magnetic fields can influence the development and incidence of abnormalities in chicken embryos13 while a stressed immune system may increase the susceptibility of a bird to infectious diseases. Plumage deterioration is the first sign of stress and illness in the birds. It has been found that the plumage of the birds exposed to microwaves get discolored though each species and each individual may show different susceptibility to radiation, because vulnerability depends upon genetic tendency, physiologic and neurological state of the irradiated organism.14–16 In nutshell, it appears increased exposure to electromagnetic field and radiations in the surrounding air support a decline in the population of various species in the country though the impact of other factors like urbanization, climate change, global warming, habitat loss and environmental pollutants cannot be completely neglected. Cellular  phones are essential to our lives for all the communications. However, their  extensive usage and upgraded services continue to threaten the species  diversity and the lives of different birds in the region. While the cellular  phones cannot be completely wiped out of our lives, it is important to find an  alternative technology that can keep the wireless communication strong but do  not pose any risk to the lives of these little creatures around us. Bird  diversity is important to keep the plant diversity and all the researchers must  try to begin looking for alternative technology for safe surroundings. None.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Researchers have discovered that certain radio waves can disrupt the magnetic compass of migratory birds. Other types of radio waves – particularly those used in mobile communication networks – do not affect the birds’ sense of orientation due to their high frequencies.  This critical finding supports the researchers’ theory that the magnetic compass sense in these birds is based on a quantum-mechanical effect. The radical pair mechanism, located in their eyes, is what they know as this. The study, led by Professor Dr. Henrik Mouritsen of the University of Oldenburg and Professor Dr. Peter Hore of the University of Oxford, combined behavioral experiments with complex quantum-mechanical calculations on a supercomputer.  The goal was to delve deeper into the connection between the quantum-mechanical mechanism, suspected to underpin the birds’ magnetic sense, and the disruption of this mechanism by radio waves.  “Our experiments, together with detailed theoretical predictions, provide strong evidence that the compass magnetoreceptor in migratory birds is based on a flavin-containing radical pair and not a completely different sort of receptor, for example one based on magnetic nanoparticles,” explained Professor Mouritsen. Magnetoreception refers to the ability of migratory birds and some other animals to use the Earth’s magnetic field for orientation.  Previously, in 2014, Mouritsen, Hore, and their colleagues demonstrated that electrosmog, the human-made electromagnetic noise generated by household electrical appliances in the AM radio waveband, impairs magnetoreception in migratory birds.  The experts proposed that this weak electrosmog, which is harmless to humans, affects the complex quantum-physical processes in certain cells in the retinas of migratory birds. These cells enable them to navigate using the Earth’s relatively weak magnetic field.  However, it remained unclear whether electrosmog also affects free-flying birds, such as long-distance migratory birds, whose numbers have been declining for unknown reasons. In the current study, the researchers set out to investigate the cut-off frequency of radio waves above which the navigation of migratory birds remains unaffected.  Determining this value would let us draw conclusions about the properties of the actual magnetic sensor in the birds. This sensor is theorized to be a light-sensitive protein called cryptochrome 4, which possesses the necessary magnetic properties.  The initial theoretical prediction was that the cut-off frequency would lie somewhere between 120 and 220 megahertz in the Very High Frequency (VHF) range.

                    Researchers have discovered that certain radio waves can disrupt the magnetic compass of migratory birds. Other types of radio waves – particularly those used in mobile communication networks – do not affect the birds’ sense of orientation due to their high frequencies.  This critical finding supports the researchers’ theory that the magnetic compass sense in these birds is based on a quantum-mechanical effect. The radical pair mechanism, located in their eyes, is what they know as this. The study, led by Professor Dr. Henrik Mouritsen of the University of Oldenburg and Professor Dr. Peter Hore of the University of Oxford, combined behavioral experiments with complex quantum-mechanical calculations on a supercomputer.  The goal was to delve deeper into the connection between the quantum-mechanical mechanism, suspected to underpin the birds’ magnetic sense, and the disruption of this mechanism by radio waves.  “Our experiments, together with detailed theoretical predictions, provide strong evidence that the compass magnetoreceptor in migratory birds is based on a flavin-containing radical pair and not a completely different sort of receptor, for example one based on magnetic nanoparticles,” explained Professor Mouritsen. Magnetoreception refers to the ability of migratory birds and some other animals to use the Earth’s magnetic field for orientation.  Previously, in 2014, Mouritsen, Hore, and their colleagues demonstrated that electrosmog, the human-made electromagnetic noise generated by household electrical appliances in the AM radio waveband, impairs magnetoreception in migratory birds.  The experts proposed that this weak electrosmog, which is harmless to humans, affects the complex quantum-physical processes in certain cells in the retinas of migratory birds. These cells enable them to navigate using the Earth’s relatively weak magnetic field.  However, it remained unclear whether electrosmog also affects free-flying birds, such as long-distance migratory birds, whose numbers have been declining for unknown reasons. In the current study, the researchers set out to investigate the cut-off frequency of radio waves above which the navigation of migratory birds remains unaffected.  Determining this value would let us draw conclusions about the properties of the actual magnetic sensor in the birds. This sensor is theorized to be a light-sensitive protein called cryptochrome 4, which possesses the necessary magnetic properties.  The initial theoretical prediction was that the cut-off frequency would lie somewhere between 120 and 220 megahertz in the Very High Frequency (VHF) range. To test this, the team conducted behavioral experiments with Eurasian blackcaps using different frequency bands within this range.  A study published in 2022 had already demonstrated that radio waves of a frequency between 75 and 85 megahertz interfere with the magnetic compass sense of these small songbirds The interference causes their magnetic compass to stop working when exposed to these radio frequencies. Conversely, they function properly without exposure.

As we humans grow older, we experience diminished sensitivity to high frequency sounds. Youthful hearing extends as high as 20,000 Hz (Hz = cycles/second). However, the average person over fifty or sixty years of age (especially among men) has completely lost the very highest frequencies and often suffers significant loss in the range from 4,000 to 10,000 Hz. Moderate to severe hearing loss above 4,000-5,000 Hz becomes the norm for many individuals living sixty and beyond. Loss of hearing with age, a condition technically referred to as “presbycusis,” is a widespread phenomenon that seemingly cannot be avoided. To make matters worse, prolonged exposure to loud music and other loud background sounds also results in reduced sensitivity in the high range (even among younger people). This is NOT good news for aging birdwatchers for the simple reason that most birds (especially songbirds) are difficult to spot and are generally discovered and identified by hearing their songs, the majority of which are in the high range. Diagram showing presbycusis – hearing loss due to aging Diagram showing presbycusis – hearing loss due to aging Another common form of high frequency hearing loss results from exposure to loud noises, either involving a single catastrophic event (eg. a nearby explosion) or else prolonged exposure to loud machinery, gunshots, music, and the like. This is referred to as “noise-induced hearing loss” (HIHL) and is typified by a moderate to extreme “notch loss” centered around 4000 Hz, with frequencies above and below less affected, depending on how much damage has occurred. Unfortunately, a huge number of birds sing in this range. The average frequency of the songs of songbirds is around 3500 to 4000 Hz, approximately the same pitch as the highest note of a piano. Many warblers, sparrows, waxwings, kinglets, and a number of other birds produce sounds that reach 8,000 Hz and above. It follows that significant hearing loss in the 3000-8000 Hz range spells disaster for those interested in birding by ear, thereby making it nearly impossible to hear the songs of a great number of species in normal outdoor situations. The situation with insects is even worse because vast majority of insect songs are at frequencies above 3,000-4,000 Hz, with some even reaching 20,000 Hz or higher. Thus, high frequency hearing loss will have a profound impact on one’s ability to hear singing crickets, katydids and cicadas. Even our ability to hear frogs and toads can be compromised. Spring Peepers chime in at around 3,000 Hz, Oaks Toads at 4500 Hz, and Little Grass Frogs at 7000 Hz. While presbycusis may not have a strong impact on the lives of city dwellers and others who rarely venture into nature, high frequency hearing loss is disastrous for bird enthusiasts because it may prevent one from hearing the vast majority of the songs and calls of our native birds. This is especially painful for older people who are new to birding … many quickly discover that they cannot hear what “most everyone else is raving about” and are thus unable to share in the excitement. Given the growing popularity of birding and all the amazing technological advances in this modern world, one would think there are a number of elegant solutions to high frequency hearing loss, but it turns out there are far fewer than one might expect.  574 words The traditional approach to counteracting hearing loss has been to utilize amplifying hearing aids that raise the amplitude of incoming signals to levels where they can be heard. In modern times, this is done with electronic hearing aids that work well in the realm of speech perception (mostly below 3,000 Hz) but have limited application for birders and other nature lovers who can hear speech reasonably well, yet are deaf to high-pitched bird songs. For aging birders, conventional amplifying-type hearing aids are usually a major disappointment. Some of the problems encountered with such devices are summarized as follows: 1) There is a limit to how much a hearing aid can amplify before feedback squeal occurs. If hearing loss is severe, maximum amplification will not be adequate to allow high bird songs to be heard at reasonable distances in typical outdoor situations. 2) Conventional aids generally do not produce good amplification above 5,000 Hz. Thus, most amplifying hearing aids offer little or no help with hearing the highest singing birds. 3) Extraneous sounds such as wind noise or the sounds that accompany walking through leaves or stepping on twigs are also amplified and can be extremely annoying. Users often complain of “sensory overload” due to the continuous high-level amplification of such environmental sounds. 4) Even when users wear amplifying aids in both ears, the ability to determine distances and directions of incoming sounds is normally much reduced. The three dimensional or binaural aspect of hearing is greatly compromised and it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to find birds, even when they are heard. 5) The ability to enjoy the “softness” of distant bird songs is entirely lost. When extreme amplification is applied, softer sounds are boosted to high levels in order to be detected. And when they are detected, they are perceived as being “very loud,” even though they’re not. This can easily overwhelm and disorient the senses. 6) Amplifying-type aids generally “plug the ears” in order to create a tight seal to reduce the possibility of feedback squeal. This not only feels uncomfortable but also prevents users with intact hearing in the lower ranges from enjoying the wide and spacious immersion of their extant natural hearing.  In spite of the problems described above, conventional amplification-type aids can certainly be helpful to those with moderate hearing loss, especially when models are used that specifically advertise exceptional high frequency response. But such hearings aids are generally quite expensive. For instance, it is not uncommon for a person to pay several thousand dollars each, with a total expenditure of well over $5000 for professional fitting in both ears. And there is no guarantee that the aids will end up being that useful in actual outdoor situations where the ability to hear and locate soft and distant sounds is all-important for a fruitful birding experience. Note: If you’ve been reading the news, you may be aware that we are on the cusp of an explosion of affordable “Personal Sound Amplification Products (PSAPs)” and over-the-counter moderate-amplification hearing aids that lie outside the highly-regulated domain of conventional hearing aids. These may help, for sure, especially when one’s hearing loss is moderate, but will probably not be able to adequately address the specialized requirements of birders and other nature lovers with loss in the higher frequencies. Nonetheless, it is a good idea to keep abreast of developments along these lines. , which is described in below.  924 words Given that potential users have moderate to severe hearing loss above around 3000Hz yet still have fairly good hearing in the lower range, up to around 2000-2500Hz or thereabouts (which is often the case for high frequency hearing loss due to both presbycutis and exposure to loud noises), a totally different approach to bringing back the high singers can be employed … and that is to pitch-shift high bird songs into the lower range where they can heard without the need for amplification. As you might guess, this is exactly what our Hear Birds Again app will do, giving the user fine-grained control over what frequencies are shifted and the degree of pitch-lowering that is applied. Furthermore, by using our app in conjunction with a loose-fitting “open-air binaural headset,” the lowered bird songs can be seamlessly added to the soundscape the user is already hearing, without impairing the user’s still-useful hearing range. There will be no plugging of the ears (as occurs with amplification aids) and the resulting mix will sound so real that the user will have difficulty distinguishing a shifted bird song from one that is being heard naturally. With the above in mind, it should be apparent that our project not only involves the creation of the pitch-shifting app itself, but also an optimal binaural headset design, so that one’s actual outdoor listening experience is as natural as possible. A detailed discussion of this matter can be found below in the section labeled The Headset Conundrum.  You may wonder how Hear Birds Again will accomplish the frequency shifting. Briefly, incoming bird sounds will be received by tiny mics positioned on the headset at each ear, and then routed into the mobile device, where they will be converted into digital signals. Our app will then selectively pitch-lower the high-range songs using advanced algorithms tailored specifically for this purpose. Finally, the pitch-lowered songs will be fed back to each ear via the headset, where they are then “mixed” with the natural soundscape one is already hearing. There are a number of approaches to frequency division and several well-known algorithms are currently available for our use. While we have already developed our own basic algorithm based on a fairly simple “sample-and-stretch” model that allows for several pitch-shift settings (one-half, one-third and one-quarter), we also intend to implement a more advanced solution that will provide considerably more control over the amount of shifting. Note that most available algorithms have been developed for shifting human speech and music. Bird songs, especially those containing numerous “rapid transients,” pose specific challenges and it turns out that some of the leaner algorithms actually produce the best results. Although we plan to implement just one or two algorithms when we launch our app, we will be continually testing new ones as they appear and then adding those that work best with bird songs.  IN CONCLUSION, our pitch-lowering solution, the Hear Birds Again mobile application used in conjunction with a special binaural headset (described below in The Headset Conundrum, will allow for the preservation of a natural, three-dimensional “binaural” listening experience where the pitch-lowered songs will be transparently mixed with sounds one is already hearing. The lowered bird songs will be heard at normal or near-normal levels and users will be able to determine their directions and distances, making it possible to actually find and observe the singers. Given that pitch-lowering does not involve extreme amplification, extraneous sounds like the rustle of leaves or the snapping of twigs will not be annoying. There will be no uncomfortable plugging of the ears. Furthermore, sensory overload will be completely avoided, feedback squeal will not occur, and the overall effect will be gentle, natural and spacious. For bird enthusiasts who suffer from moderate to severe high frequency hearing loss but who still have fairly normal hearing up to around 2000Hz, Hear Birds Again used in conjunction with a well-designed binaural headset will provide an excellent solution to the problem of bringing back the high singing birds. A Note About Pitch-lowering in Amplification-type Hearing Aids: There are a number of advanced (and often very expensive) amplification-type hearing aids that utilize some form of pitch-shifting to help with speech discrimination. Sometimes they even advertise improved ability to hear bird and other nature sounds. Unfortunately, most of these algorithms are designed specifically for improved human speech recognition and do not work well with bird songs.  In some cases, only a narrow high-frequency band is shifted downward, which means that the songs of many species will be missed. Other algorithms may aggressively “compress” the high frequencies into a narrow, lower frequency band, thereby flattening or squashing the bird songs and degrading harmonic relationships. Still other so-called “adaptive” algorithms may only respond to the high-pitched portions of speech (such as “ssss” or “shhhh”) while actively rejecting other types of sounds, including many bird songs or calls. So … one should not expect great results just because an expensive amplification-type hearing aid includes pitch-lowering features. But this doesn’t mean that all expensive aids will be inadequate in this respect. As part of this project, we will be testing conventional aids whenever possible, in hopes that we can determine which brands utilize pitch-shifting algorithms that work well with bird songs and allow for most of the high-pitched singers to be heard.  Hear Birds Again will be targeted at those who suffer from moderate to severe high frequency hearing loss in the higher ranges, but who still have fairly good hearing up to around 2,000-2,500 Hz in both ears. Such individuals may be almost completely deaf to high-pitched bird songs but will be able to hear human speech and low singing birds such as whip-poor-wills, robins, and cardinals, without the need for special hearing aid devices.  Note that while our app will primarily be a pitch-lowering device, it will also offer a reasonable degree of amplification of the pitch-lowered signals, which will be helpful to those are have some loss at the low end.  We strongly advise potential users to obtain an audiogram from an audiologist, who should be instructed to pay particular attention to high frequency response, preferably measuring up to 8000Hz. Look for moderate to severe hearing loss above 3,000-4,000 Hz with normal or near-normal hearing up to around 2,000 Hz. You might also try testing yourself using the exceptional online hearing test kindly provided by the University of New South Wales. If there is moderate loss at around 2,000 Hz, the utility of our app will be somewhat reduced, but note that users can easily boost the volume of pitch-lowered bird songs to compensate. In addition, it will usually possible to use our recommended binaural headset in conjunction with conventional hearing aids, although feedback squeal may be a significant issue.   We will be experimenting with ways to make Hear Birds Again more usable by people with moderate loss in the lower range, possibly by allowing for amplified “pass-through” of the low end without any pitch-shifting. However, due to potential feedback problems, a specially-designed headset would be required that fits tightly over both ears. Please refer to section below to gain a greater understanding of the challenges involved with regard to headset design and functionality. While our Hear Birds Again application can be roughly-tested using the mobile device’s internal microphones in conjunction with earbuds, users will not experience the pitch-lowered bird songs in a natural three-dimensional space and will not be able to accurately judge their distances and directions. In order for high-pitched singers to both be heard and located in the environment, our app must be used in conjunction with a well-designed “binaural headset” that has mics mounted at each ear, thereby simulating our natural hearing where our two ears are spaced about seven inches apart, with an absorbent barrier (= the head) lying in between.  The reason this is important is that our brains are hard-wired to decipher audio signals produced by this arrangement, which preserves critical binaural directional cues such as “inter-aural time differences” and “inter-aural level differences” of sounds arriving at the two ears. Think about it … a bird song originating from the right will arrive at the right ear before it arrives at the left ear, the delay being a function of the speed of sound. Furthermore, the bird song will be louder in the right ear and more subdued in the left ear, due to the blockage or absorbance of the head. So, if a binaural headset is used, the directional cues will be preserved as the left and right input signals are processed and then fed back to the listener via the corresponding receivers in the headset. The brain then processes the pitch-lowered sounds automatically, and literally “projects” them into a natural three-dimensional space that sounds so real and spacious that listeners may not realize that a detected bird song has been lowered in pitch. Quite obviously, use of a binaural headset is critical to having the highest quality experience, but there’s a problem here: Currently, there are no off-the-shelf commercial binaural headsets available in the marketplace, and certainly none that meet two necessary criteria: 1) The headset must include two “super low-noise” input mics, securely mounted next to each ear (mics with low self-noise are especially important for detecting soft and distant bird songs in natural environments). 2) The headset must employ a loose-fitting open-air design that does not plug the ears, so that lower-pitched sounds (in the range where one’s hearing is still normal or near-normal) are heard naturally,  just as they are when the headset is not worn.  Now you may understand why the title of this section is “The Headset Conundrum.” Use of a binaural headset is all-important, yet none are currently available in the marketplace. So what are we to do? Well, at least for the time-being, there is only one obvious solution, and that is to to build optimal headsets using readily-available materials. And that is the approach we’re taking. In fact … we have already prototyped a headset design that works great in the field and that will lend itself well to a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. We have also partnered with micbooster.com, a firm in the UK that makes miniature low-noise microphone modules optimized for recording natural sounds. Micbooster is now providing “headset kits” that include pre-wired mics, earphones, and all other materials needed for the final construction … which will require very little effort from buyers. In addition, for those who are adept at soldering miniature components, we provide a detailed list of components (which can be ordered separately), along with assembly instructions. If demand for headsets turns out to be great enough, it is quite likely that one or more enterprising individuals will decide to build and sell fully-assembled headsets. Below is a photo of our current prototype headset, a relatively straightforward design that works splendidly in the field. Go Here for information about ordering headset kits from micbooster.com, or else buying components individually. You may wonder why our headset is “wired” to the iPhone, when wireless bluetooth has become so ubiquitous. The answer is a bit complicated.  First off, it is currently quite difficult to enable “two way communication” where a two-channel input (from the headset mics) is processed by the mobile app and then fed back to the headphones without any delay. Bluetooth has latency (delay) issues in both directions, which means that the pitch-shifted output sent back to the headphones will be slightly delayed in comparison to the actual sounds occurring in nature. In a completely closed system, this might make little difference (although it would be obvious if one is actually watching a bird sing and the movements of the beak precede the pitch-lowered song phrases being heard). When using an open-air approach, however, the problem will be compounded with bird songs that have both high and low elements (such as robin songs). In such cases, the high portions of songs will be pitch-shifted and therefore delayed, while the lower elements will be heard in real time, with no delay, Thus, mixing the two together would cause a noticeable degradation of the internal timing of the song. Yet another significant problem with the bluetooth approach is that adding two bluetooth transmitters and receivers to the headset would significantly increase its bulk and weight, making it more difficult to use. So, at least for now, there is no reasonable way to make a compact bluetooth headset that will produce optimal results. While our straightforward wired solution may seem a bit archaic, it is eminently workable in the here and now, and there are no annoying delays in the routing of sounds into and out of the mobile device.  We definitely look forward to the day when a fully-wireless headset can be implemented. In the best-case scenario, some large manufacturer of assistive listening devices will build and sell “the perfect binaural headset,” input mics included, with an integrated bird-song-optimized pitch-lowering algorithm built into the electronics inside the headset (which means there would be no latency issues). Wishful thinking? Perhaps, but why not hope for the best? The headset design that we described above assumes reasonably good hearing up to around 2000Hz. It utilizes an “open-air” design where the receivers sit lightly on each ear and do not obstruct one’s intact hearing. This approach works great for those who still have useful hearing in the mid-range, but it does not adequately address those who have substantial loss below 2000Hz. An entirely different approach is to use closed-back headphones with foam ear cups that provide maximum isolation and rejection of outside sounds … in other words, a closed system. Such headphones may also employ active noise-cancellation circuitry to attain even greater isolation (eg. the Bose QuietComfort). Mics can be mounted on the outside of such headphones, with wires leading into the iPhone. Our app could then do the pitch-lowering and also provide an amplified “pass-through” of the lower range, to compensate for hearing loss in that range. A tight seal is required because pass-through amplification can easily cause feedback squeal, if the mics are able to “hear” the signal coming out of the headset receivers. With this approach, the user will only hear what is coming through the headset and no aspect of the soundscape would be heard directly. Obviously, such a closed system would give full control over both the loudness of the lowered high-pitched bird songs as well as the loudness of the lower un-processed “pass-through” signals. Thus a binaural sound-field would be experienced entirely through the headset itself. This approach is certainly viable, but there are caveats. One big concern is that feedback squeal will cause problems if there is too much amplification of the pass-through signals. Another concern is that the microphones mounted on the outside of the headset will be extremely sensitive to wind, which means that the slightest breeze may easily cause low frequency distortions (a problem largely eliminated by the “high-pass” filtering of mic input signals that occurs with our open-air approach). In spite of the problems associated with a closed-system approach, we plan to experiment with various headset designs (coupled with modifications of our app) to see if we can come up with a workable do-it-yourself solution for nature enthusiasts with mild to moderate hearing loss at frequencies below 2000Hz. © 2022 – “Hear Birds Again” – A special project of miracleofnature.org

Diagram showing presbycusis – hearing loss due to aging Diagram showing presbycusis – hearing loss due to aging Another common form of high frequency hearing loss results from exposure to loud noises, either involving a single catastrophic event (eg. a nearby explosion) or else prolonged exposure to loud machinery, gunshots, music, and the like. This is referred to as “noise-induced hearing loss” (HIHL) and is typified by a moderate to extreme “notch loss” centered around 4000 Hz, with frequencies above and below less affected, depending on how much damage has occurred. Unfortunately, a huge number of birds sing in this range. The average frequency of the songs of songbirds is around 3500 to 4000 Hz, approximately the same pitch as the highest note of a piano. Many warblers, sparrows, waxwings, kinglets, and a number of other birds produce sounds that reach 8,000 Hz and above. It follows that significant hearing loss in the 3000-8000 Hz range spells disaster for those interested in birding by ear, thereby making it nearly impossible to hear the songs of a great number of species in normal outdoor situations. The situation with insects is even worse because vast majority of insect songs are at frequencies above 3,000-4,000 Hz, with some even reaching 20,000 Hz or higher. Thus, high frequency hearing loss will have a profound impact on one’s ability to hear singing crickets, katydids and cicadas. Even our ability to hear frogs and toads can be compromised. Spring Peepers chime in at around 3,000 Hz, Oaks Toads at 4500 Hz, and Little Grass Frogs at 7000 Hz. While presbycusis may not have a strong impact on the lives of city dwellers and others who rarely venture into nature, high frequency hearing loss is disastrous for bird enthusiasts because it may prevent one from hearing the vast majority of the songs and calls of our native birds. This is especially painful for older people who are new to birding … many quickly discover that they cannot hear what “most everyone else is raving about” and are thus unable to share in the excitement. Given the growing popularity of birding and all the amazing technological advances in this modern world, one would think there are a number of elegant solutions to high frequency hearing loss, but it turns out there are far fewer than one might expect.  574 words The traditional approach to counteracting hearing loss has been to utilize amplifying hearing aids that raise the amplitude of incoming signals to levels where they can be heard. In modern times, this is done with electronic hearing aids that work well in the realm of speech perception (mostly below 3,000 Hz) but have limited application for birders and other nature lovers who can hear speech reasonably well, yet are deaf to high-pitched bird songs. For aging birders, conventional amplifying-type hearing aids are usually a major disappointment. Some of the problems encountered with such devices are summarized as follows: 1) There is a limit to how much a hearing aid can amplify before feedback squeal occurs. If hearing loss is severe, maximum amplification will not be adequate to allow high bird songs to be heard at reasonable distances in typical outdoor situations. 2) Conventional aids generally do not produce good amplification above 5,000 Hz. Thus, most amplifying hearing aids offer little or no help with hearing the highest singing birds. 3) Extraneous sounds such as wind noise or the sounds that accompany walking through leaves or stepping on twigs are also amplified and can be extremely annoying. Users often complain of “sensory overload” due to the continuous high-level amplification of such environmental sounds. 4) Even when users wear amplifying aids in both ears, the ability to determine distances and directions of incoming sounds is normally much reduced. The three dimensional or binaural aspect of hearing is greatly compromised and it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to find birds, even when they are heard. 5) The ability to enjoy the “softness” of distant bird songs is entirely lost. When extreme amplification is applied, softer sounds are boosted to high levels in order to be detected. And when they are detected, they are perceived as being “very loud,” even though they’re not. This can easily overwhelm and disorient the senses. 6) Amplifying-type aids generally “plug the ears” in order to create a tight seal to reduce the possibility of feedback squeal. This not only feels uncomfortable but also prevents users with intact hearing in the lower ranges from enjoying the wide and spacious immersion of their extant natural hearing.  In spite of the problems described above, conventional amplification-type aids can certainly be helpful to those with moderate hearing loss, especially when models are used that specifically advertise exceptional high frequency response. But such hearings aids are generally quite expensive. For instance, it is not uncommon for a person to pay several thousand dollars each, with a total expenditure of well over $5000 for professional fitting in both ears. And there is no guarantee that the aids will end up being that useful in actual outdoor situations where the ability to hear and locate soft and distant sounds is all-important for a fruitful birding experience. Note: If you’ve been reading the news, you may be aware that we are on the cusp of an explosion of affordable “Personal Sound Amplification Products (PSAPs)” and over-the-counter moderate-amplification hearing aids that lie outside the highly-regulated domain of conventional hearing aids. These may help, for sure, especially when one’s hearing loss is moderate, but will probably not be able to adequately address the specialized requirements of birders and other nature lovers with loss in the higher frequencies. Nonetheless, it is a good idea to keep abreast of developments along these lines. , which is described in below.  924 words Given that potential users have moderate to severe hearing loss above around 3000Hz yet still have fairly good hearing in the lower range, up to around 2000-2500Hz or thereabouts (which is often the case for high frequency hearing loss due to both presbycutis and exposure to loud noises), a totally different approach to bringing back the high singers can be employed … and that is to pitch-shift high bird songs into the lower range where they can heard without the need for amplification. As you might guess, this is exactly what our Hear Birds Again app will do, giving the user fine-grained control over what frequencies are shifted and the degree of pitch-lowering that is applied. Furthermore, by using our app in conjunction with a loose-fitting “open-air binaural headset,” the lowered bird songs can be seamlessly added to the soundscape the user is already hearing, without impairing the user’s still-useful hearing range. There will be no plugging of the ears (as occurs with amplification aids) and the resulting mix will sound so real that the user will have difficulty distinguishing a shifted bird song from one that is being heard naturally. With the above in mind, it should be apparent that our project not only involves the creation of the pitch-shifting app itself, but also an optimal binaural headset design, so that one’s actual outdoor listening experience is as natural as possible. A detailed discussion of this matter can be found below in the section labeled The Headset Conundrum.  You may wonder how Hear Birds Again will accomplish the frequency shifting. Briefly, incoming bird sounds will be received by tiny mics positioned on the headset at each ear, and then routed into the mobile device, where they will be converted into digital signals. Our app will then selectively pitch-lower the high-range songs using advanced algorithms tailored specifically for this purpose. Finally, the pitch-lowered songs will be fed back to each ear via the headset, where they are then “mixed” with the natural soundscape one is already hearing. There are a number of approaches to frequency division and several well-known algorithms are currently available for our use. While we have already developed our own basic algorithm based on a fairly simple “sample-and-stretch” model that allows for several pitch-shift settings (one-half, one-third and one-quarter), we also intend to implement a more advanced solution that will provide considerably more control over the amount of shifting. Note that most available algorithms have been developed for shifting human speech and music. Bird songs, especially those containing numerous “rapid transients,” pose specific challenges and it turns out that some of the leaner algorithms actually produce the best results. Although we plan to implement just one or two algorithms when we launch our app, we will be continually testing new ones as they appear and then adding those that work best with bird songs.  IN CONCLUSION, our pitch-lowering solution, the Hear Birds Again mobile application used in conjunction with a special binaural headset (described below in The Headset Conundrum, will allow for the preservation of a natural, three-dimensional “binaural” listening experience where the pitch-lowered songs will be transparently mixed with sounds one is already hearing. The lowered bird songs will be heard at normal or near-normal levels and users will be able to determine their directions and distances, making it possible to actually find and observe the singers. Given that pitch-lowering does not involve extreme amplification, extraneous sounds like the rustle of leaves or the snapping of twigs will not be annoying. There will be no uncomfortable plugging of the ears. Furthermore, sensory overload will be completely avoided, feedback squeal will not occur, and the overall effect will be gentle, natural and spacious. For bird enthusiasts who suffer from moderate to severe high frequency hearing loss but who still have fairly normal hearing up to around 2000Hz, Hear Birds Again used in conjunction with a well-designed binaural headset will provide an excellent solution to the problem of bringing back the high singing birds. A Note About Pitch-lowering in Amplification-type Hearing Aids: There are a number of advanced (and often very expensive) amplification-type hearing aids that utilize some form of pitch-shifting to help with speech discrimination. Sometimes they even advertise improved ability to hear bird and other nature sounds. Unfortunately, most of these algorithms are designed specifically for improved human speech recognition and do not work well with bird songs.  In some cases, only a narrow high-frequency band is shifted downward, which means that the songs of many species will be missed. Other algorithms may aggressively “compress” the high frequencies into a narrow, lower frequency band, thereby flattening or squashing the bird songs and degrading harmonic relationships. Still other so-called “adaptive” algorithms may only respond to the high-pitched portions of speech (such as “ssss” or “shhhh”) while actively rejecting other types of sounds, including many bird songs or calls. So … one should not expect great results just because an expensive amplification-type hearing aid includes pitch-lowering features. But this doesn’t mean that all expensive aids will be inadequate in this respect. As part of this project, we will be testing conventional aids whenever possible, in hopes that we can determine which brands utilize pitch-shifting algorithms that work well with bird songs and allow for most of the high-pitched singers to be heard.  Hear Birds Again will be targeted at those who suffer from moderate to severe high frequency hearing loss in the higher ranges, but who still have fairly good hearing up to around 2,000-2,500 Hz in both ears. Such individuals may be almost completely deaf to high-pitched bird songs but will be able to hear human speech and low singing birds such as whip-poor-wills, robins, and cardinals, without the need for special hearing aid devices.  Note that while our app will primarily be a pitch-lowering device, it will also offer a reasonable degree of amplification of the pitch-lowered signals, which will be helpful to those are have some loss at the low end.  We strongly advise potential users to obtain an audiogram from an audiologist, who should be instructed to pay particular attention to high frequency response, preferably measuring up to 8000Hz. Look for moderate to severe hearing loss above 3,000-4,000 Hz with normal or near-normal hearing up to around 2,000 Hz. You might also try testing yourself using the exceptional online hearing test kindly provided by the University of New South Wales. If there is moderate loss at around 2,000 Hz, the utility of our app will be somewhat reduced, but note that users can easily boost the volume of pitch-lowered bird songs to compensate. In addition, it will usually possible to use our recommended binaural headset in conjunction with conventional hearing aids, although feedback squeal may be a significant issue.   We will be experimenting with ways to make Hear Birds Again more usable by people with moderate loss in the lower range, possibly by allowing for amplified “pass-through” of the low end without any pitch-shifting. However, due to potential feedback problems, a specially-designed headset would be required that fits tightly over both ears. Please refer to section below to gain a greater understanding of the challenges involved with regard to headset design and functionality. While our Hear Birds Again application can be roughly-tested using the mobile device’s internal microphones in conjunction with earbuds, users will not experience the pitch-lowered bird songs in a natural three-dimensional space and will not be able to accurately judge their distances and directions. In order for high-pitched singers to both be heard and located in the environment, our app must be used in conjunction with a well-designed “binaural headset” that has mics mounted at each ear, thereby simulating our natural hearing where our two ears are spaced about seven inches apart, with an absorbent barrier (= the head) lying in between.  The reason this is important is that our brains are hard-wired to decipher audio signals produced by this arrangement, which preserves critical binaural directional cues such as “inter-aural time differences” and “inter-aural level differences” of sounds arriving at the two ears. Think about it … a bird song originating from the right will arrive at the right ear before it arrives at the left ear, the delay being a function of the speed of sound. Furthermore, the bird song will be louder in the right ear and more subdued in the left ear, due to the blockage or absorbance of the head. So, if a binaural headset is used, the directional cues will be preserved as the left and right input signals are processed and then fed back to the listener via the corresponding receivers in the headset. The brain then processes the pitch-lowered sounds automatically, and literally “projects” them into a natural three-dimensional space that sounds so real and spacious that listeners may not realize that a detected bird song has been lowered in pitch. Quite obviously, use of a binaural headset is critical to having the highest quality experience, but there’s a problem here: Currently, there are no off-the-shelf commercial binaural headsets available in the marketplace, and certainly none that meet two necessary criteria: 1) The headset must include two “super low-noise” input mics, securely mounted next to each ear (mics with low self-noise are especially important for detecting soft and distant bird songs in natural environments). 2) The headset must employ a loose-fitting open-air design that does not plug the ears, so that lower-pitched sounds (in the range where one’s hearing is still normal or near-normal) are heard naturally,  just as they are when the headset is not worn.  Now you may understand why the title of this section is “The Headset Conundrum.” Use of a binaural headset is all-important, yet none are currently available in the marketplace. So what are we to do? Well, at least for the time-being, there is only one obvious solution, and that is to to build optimal headsets using readily-available materials. And that is the approach we’re taking. In fact … we have already prototyped a headset design that works great in the field and that will lend itself well to a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. We have also partnered with micbooster.com, a firm in the UK that makes miniature low-noise microphone modules optimized for recording natural sounds. Micbooster is now providing “headset kits” that include pre-wired mics, earphones, and all other materials needed for the final construction … which will require very little effort from buyers. In addition, for those who are adept at soldering miniature components, we provide a detailed list of components (which can be ordered separately), along with assembly instructions. If demand for headsets turns out to be great enough, it is quite likely that one or more enterprising individuals will decide to build and sell fully-assembled headsets. Below is a photo of our current prototype headset, a relatively straightforward design that works splendidly in the field. Go Here for information about ordering headset kits from micbooster.com, or else buying components individually. You may wonder why our headset is “wired” to the iPhone, when wireless bluetooth has become so ubiquitous. The answer is a bit complicated.  First off, it is currently quite difficult to enable “two way communication” where a two-channel input (from the headset mics) is processed by the mobile app and then fed back to the headphones without any delay. Bluetooth has latency (delay) issues in both directions, which means that the pitch-shifted output sent back to the headphones will be slightly delayed in comparison to the actual sounds occurring in nature. In a completely closed system, this might make little difference (although it would be obvious if one is actually watching a bird sing and the movements of the beak precede the pitch-lowered song phrases being heard). When using an open-air approach, however, the problem will be compounded with bird songs that have both high and low elements (such as robin songs). In such cases, the high portions of songs will be pitch-shifted and therefore delayed, while the lower elements will be heard in real time, with no delay, Thus, mixing the two together would cause a noticeable degradation of the internal timing of the song. Yet another significant problem with the bluetooth approach is that adding two bluetooth transmitters and receivers to the headset would significantly increase its bulk and weight, making it more difficult to use. So, at least for now, there is no reasonable way to make a compact bluetooth headset that will produce optimal results. While our straightforward wired solution may seem a bit archaic, it is eminently workable in the here and now, and there are no annoying delays in the routing of sounds into and out of the mobile device.  We definitely look forward to the day when a fully-wireless headset can be implemented. In the best-case scenario, some large manufacturer of assistive listening devices will build and sell “the perfect binaural headset,” input mics included, with an integrated bird-song-optimized pitch-lowering algorithm built into the electronics inside the headset (which means there would be no latency issues). Wishful thinking? Perhaps, but why not hope for the best? The headset design that we described above assumes reasonably good hearing up to around 2000Hz. It utilizes an “open-air” design where the receivers sit lightly on each ear and do not obstruct one’s intact hearing. This approach works great for those who still have useful hearing in the mid-range, but it does not adequately address those who have substantial loss below 2000Hz. An entirely different approach is to use closed-back headphones with foam ear cups that provide maximum isolation and rejection of outside sounds … in other words, a closed system. Such headphones may also employ active noise-cancellation circuitry to attain even greater isolation (eg. the Bose QuietComfort). Mics can be mounted on the outside of such headphones, with wires leading into the iPhone. Our app could then do the pitch-lowering and also provide an amplified “pass-through” of the lower range, to compensate for hearing loss in that range. A tight seal is required because pass-through amplification can easily cause feedback squeal, if the mics are able to “hear” the signal coming out of the headset receivers. With this approach, the user will only hear what is coming through the headset and no aspect of the soundscape would be heard directly. Obviously, such a closed system would give full control over both the loudness of the lowered high-pitched bird songs as well as the loudness of the lower un-processed “pass-through” signals. Thus a binaural sound-field would be experienced entirely through the headset itself. This approach is certainly viable, but there are caveats. One big concern is that feedback squeal will cause problems if there is too much amplification of the pass-through signals. Another concern is that the microphones mounted on the outside of the headset will be extremely sensitive to wind, which means that the slightest breeze may easily cause low frequency distortions (a problem largely eliminated by the “high-pass” filtering of mic input signals that occurs with our open-air approach). In spite of the problems associated with a closed-system approach, we plan to experiment with various headset designs (coupled with modifications of our app) to see if we can come up with a workable do-it-yourself solution for nature enthusiasts with mild to moderate hearing loss at frequencies below 2000Hz. © 2022 – “Hear Birds Again” – A special project of miracleofnature.org

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Every other Friday on Morning Edition, Outside/In host Sam Evans-Brown tackles a question from a listener.  Peter from Londonderry asks: Are there certain audio frequencies that birds can hear but humans can’t, in a similar way that dog whistles work? Humans (especially brand new baby humans that haven’t damaged their delicate hair cells) can hear up to 20,000 hertz. Dogs can hear up to 35,000 or even 65,000 hertz. In hunting around for studies on bird hearing, I was directed to one promisingly titled High Frequency Hearing in a Hummingbird which claimed to have found “the highest in any bird vocalization known to date” made by the Ecuadorian Hillstar Hummingbird which was around… 13,000 hertz.  The piece notes, “The frequency content of this song is also far beyond the hearing range in most birds (2 to 8 kHz).” So the answer, in so far as we know currently, is “No.” Next question? … Just kidding, that’s not all! Now watch me pivot seamlessly to other nifty bird hearing facts. Birds Hear in Slow Motion Smaller creatures generally, including birds, actually perceive time differently than we do. A paper from 2013 detailed an experiment where researchers measured the neural response of animals to a blinking strobe light. Researchers sped up the blinking, faster and faster, until animals started to perceive it as not blinking anymore. The finding was that the smaller the creature, the faster they were able to distinguish the blinking. A later study focused on birds specifically, and found a similar pattern: the smaller the bird, the faster it perceives the world. And with birds, this means they’re able to distinguish between notes in bird song that go by too fast for the human ear.  Owls Have Astonishing Ears The unchallenged champions in avian audition are owls, particularly barn owls. Their ears are asymmetrical, which apparently helps them to distinguish the elevation of their prey, so they can swoop down on them in the middle of the night. And Marcela Fernandez-Peters, a researcher at UMass Amherst, says that when you look inside the hearing organs and brains of owls, “they do have a lot of real estate dedicated to these high frequencies.” Which is to say, they might not hear super high pitched sounds, but they’re *very* good at hearing the frequencies they do hear. Experiments have shown that barn owls hunt almost entirely with their ears. One “classic” experiment featured mice walking on a quiet surface through a dark room, but with a noisy piece of paper tied behind them, which led the owls to attack the paper. Birds Don’t Go Deaf And lastly, the niftiest thing about bird ears — and the thing that we’re most interested in studying because it would be useful for us to know how they do it — birds don’t get hearing loss. The little delicate hair cells that we use to detect sound? In humans, once you damage them, they’re gone forever. Birds grow them back.

                    Every other Friday on Morning Edition, Outside/In host Sam Evans-Brown tackles a question from a listener.  Peter from Londonderry asks: Are there certain audio frequencies that birds can hear but humans can’t, in a similar way that dog whistles work? Humans (especially brand new baby humans that haven’t damaged their delicate hair cells) can hear up to 20,000 hertz. Dogs can hear up to 35,000 or even 65,000 hertz. In hunting around for studies on bird hearing, I was directed to one promisingly titled High Frequency Hearing in a Hummingbird which claimed to have found “the highest in any bird vocalization known to date” made by the Ecuadorian Hillstar Hummingbird which was around… 13,000 hertz.  The piece notes, “The frequency content of this song is also far beyond the hearing range in most birds (2 to 8 kHz).” So the answer, in so far as we know currently, is “No.” Next question? … Just kidding, that’s not all! Now watch me pivot seamlessly to other nifty bird hearing facts. Birds Hear in Slow Motion Smaller creatures generally, including birds, actually perceive time differently than we do. A paper from 2013 detailed an experiment where researchers measured the neural response of animals to a blinking strobe light. Researchers sped up the blinking, faster and faster, until animals started to perceive it as not blinking anymore. The finding was that the smaller the creature, the faster they were able to distinguish the blinking. A later study focused on birds specifically, and found a similar pattern: the smaller the bird, the faster it perceives the world. And with birds, this means they’re able to distinguish between notes in bird song that go by too fast for the human ear.  Owls Have Astonishing Ears The unchallenged champions in avian audition are owls, particularly barn owls. Their ears are asymmetrical, which apparently helps them to distinguish the elevation of their prey, so they can swoop down on them in the middle of the night. And Marcela Fernandez-Peters, a researcher at UMass Amherst, says that when you look inside the hearing organs and brains of owls, “they do have a lot of real estate dedicated to these high frequencies.” Which is to say, they might not hear super high pitched sounds, but they’re *very* good at hearing the frequencies they do hear. Experiments have shown that barn owls hunt almost entirely with their ears. One “classic” experiment featured mice walking on a quiet surface through a dark room, but with a noisy piece of paper tied behind them, which led the owls to attack the paper. Birds Don’t Go Deaf And lastly, the niftiest thing about bird ears — and the thing that we’re most interested in studying because it would be useful for us to know how they do it — birds don’t get hearing loss. The little delicate hair cells that we use to detect sound? In humans, once you damage them, they’re gone forever. Birds grow them back. There are researchers out there trying to figure out how to harness that to our advantage, which — and I say this as human, not just the son of an audiologist — is pretty cool.

View CartCheckout  Sound has an essential role in a bird’s life. But the sounds that they are exposed to in our human environment are very different from the sounds in the wild. Therefore, as bird keepers and caregivers, there are a series of things to consider about how sound affects birds to ensure their wellbeing.   African Grey parrot. When two hands clap together, a sound wave is created. This sound wave naturally expands making all the space around it vibrate like the strings of a guitar. Of course, that process happens at the invisible molecular level. When that wave reaches our ears we can perceive it as sound. However, there are many sounds that are out of the range of what a person can hear. On the other hand, each bird species has a different hearing range. Each species developed their hearing in the wild according of their unique habitat and lifestyle. Science is discovering that each bird’s song is adapted to their ecosystem [1]. For example, Amazon parrots would produce lower frequency sounds because those reach further through the dense vegetation of the rainforest. And Budgerigars, that live in the Australian savannas (grasslands), would emit higher frequency sounds that travel more efficiently close to the ground.   Returning to the birds in our homes and aviaries, the sounds that they hear around have an influence on them.      Birds have the ability of perceiving very specific qualities of sound, such as the frequency, intensity (loudness or softness) and the timing [2]. This is why some domestic sounds and noises can upset our birds causing them to become stressed. This happens because our birds may recognize these sounds and noises as a distress call or an approaching danger [3]. Common household sounds such as a door slamming, the loud volume of a TV and shouting can upset our birds. Ronald P. Larkin found that migrating birds could shift their route when frightening thunder noises were broadcast from a loudspeaker on the ground [4].   Yellow-eared parrots at nesting cavity. Likewise, researchers have noted that the noises coming from our cities, and commercial and industrial areas have caused fewer birds to breed in those areas [5]. When we consider the wide range of sounds that our parrots may be responding to, we have a clever way of knowing which sounds they do like. I’m talking about the comfort sounds of your parrot. Once we recognize what those sounds are, we can better understand how to create a nice, peaceful, environment for them. You can learn more about this in the article: “Parrot Comfort Sounds”. Here at Best Bird Food Ever we are very interested in hearing your parrot’s comfort sounds. Please feel free to record and share them with us!   In conclusion, even though birds enjoy adding their own vocalizations to the symphony of nature, they are also affected by the sounds around them. So we must consider this connection when creating a healthy environment for them.   Keep the conversation going by leaving your comments beneath today’s blog!   REFERENCES As a new bird owner, one of my biggest concerns was implementing a nourishing and health-promoting care plan that brought out the best in my birds.

 Lowell, IN 46356 USA Last Updated on February 16, 2023 by Mitch Rezman Editor’s note: full transparency, I don’t think we’ve ever covered the subject of pet birds and hearing.   Once again a loyal reader comes through with a potentially serious issue that until now we have left opaque.   Many of us take for granted that our birds can hear but exactly how good is their hearing, how has it evolved and how do they use it?  So I’m going to cut out the middleman and present you with a (technical) document that drills down to the heart of the avian hearing subject. What can birds hear Robert C. Beason
USDA Wildlife Services, National Wildlife Research Center, Ohio Field Station, Sandusky, Ohio Some excerpts I found interesting   One problem with infrasound and other low frequencies, especially for birds, is determination of the direction of the sound source. Because their ears are close together, mechanisms that function at higher frequencies are not usable. One technique birds could use to locate a sound source would be to fly in a circle and use the doppler shifts to determine direction (Quine and Kreithen 1981, Hagstrum 2000). Two problems that birds face, along with humans working in environments with loud noises, are damage to the hair cell receptors of the auditory system caused by overstimulation, and hearing signals above the background noise. Pyrotechnics, including bangers, poppers, screamers, etc., are biologically relevant sounds because they provide the acoustic information generated by a (human) predator without the
actual predatory attack   I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.   Endnote BTW, If you have ever heard a train coming from one direction, you’ll have noticed that its sound gets louder as it approaches and begins to dim as it passes. You could tell the direction of the train with your eyes closed, just by the sound. That’s the doppler effect at work.    Susan D. Fong  wrote: Hi Mitch, I hope that all is well.  I had a very strange thing happen last Sunday.  I was awakened at 12:30 AM by VERY LOUD and BLARING music.  I was a bit dazed, having been woken up so abruptly, and figured that it was coming from outside on the street as I live in a commercial area.  I thought a car must have been stopped at the traffic light beneath my window and was blaring its music from the car windows.  I laid there and wasn’t happy about being disturbed from a sound sleep which is difficult for me to come by these days.  I said to myself that this was a VERY LONG light. I, then, realized that the loud music was coming from the right side through my bedroom door. I was frightened and thought that someone had broken into my apt and picked up the remote to my home theater system and turned it on.  The volume was the highest it could go. Seymour’s (a white-bellied caique) cage is in my living room and she was subjected to this tremendous volume. I mustered up the courage and entered my living room only to find that there was no one there except the music was blaring and probably woke the tenant above up along with his family.  I quickly turned off the system. I got Seymour out of her birdcage and held her close. She seemed un-phased. A half-hour later, the music started up again, and knowing that this would just continue happening, I had to disconnect the system which wasn’t easy as I had to get behind some things to disconnect the power adapter.  I called BOSE the next day and was told that a neighbor’s remote control may be on the same frequency as my unit and just kept turning my system on.  This apparently can happen through brick (concrete) walls for a distance of up to 65 ft. Rather than change the frequency of my remote, I have opted to just keep my home theater system disconnected until I plan on using it.     It’s a shame that this happened because it is a hassle to have to keep plugging and unplugging the system. I was very concerned that the blaring volume might have damaged Seymour’s hearing and I googled it to find out that a bird’s hearing can NEVER get damaged.  A bird’s hearing will rebound back to normal. I was so happy to learn of this. Please feel free to share my story with your readers if you would like to write an article about a bird’s hearing.
