We all know that summer gardens are full of glorious color, but we're here to tell you that the show doesn't have to end when the warm weather fades! Gardens and yards have plenty to offer come autumn, including gorgeous fall flowers that continue to bloom until the first hard freeze. Pair them with your pretty pumpkins and your fall landscape will be the best on the street! These options don't start and end with the fall flowers for pots and containers like the pretty mums you see incorporated into fall porch décor. Autumnal landscapes can include fall-friendly shrubs, annuals, and perennials, which come back yearly! Mix all three types of plants to add structure and depth to your fall garden. The variety provides cover and food for pollinators, and turns your yard into a welcoming space for guests—critters and humans alike! And believe it or not, fall is a great time to plant perennials and evergreen shrubs when temperatures are less extreme and rainfall is plentiful. Just be sure to give plants plenty of time to establish roots before winter. That's about six weeks before the ground freezes, or typically no later than mid-November for most of the country. To give your plant a good start in life, read the plant tag or description to see what kind of light it needs. For example, full sun means an area gets six or more hours, while part sun is about half that. Bonus tip: When choosing perennials and shrubs, make sure they can handle winters in your USDA plant hardiness zone. Ready to add to your outdoor fall decorations? Check out our favorite fall flowers every gardener needs! With their cheerful, daisy-like flowers, there's just something so charming and irresistible about cosmos. That's probably why they're so often used in bouquets and flower arrangements. Cut a few to place into vases around your home for fun pops of color or throw them in your garden to produce blooms from summer into fall. They'll even attract birds, bees, and butterflies.  Varieties to try: Dazzler, Fizzy Pink SHOP COSMO SEEDS These fuchsia have incredibly eye-catching two-tone pendent flowers that will bring such a special touch to your yard—but they're a little fussy when it comes to soil. Conditions shouldn't be too wet, too dry, or too hot. Get it just right and the shrub will reliably persist through fall with dangling blossoms galore.  Varieties to try: Beacon, Dollar Princess A deep yellow color makes the aptly-named goldenrod flower a good choice for any autumn garden—but beware: It's sometimes considered a weed because of its tendency to multiply. Despite this, you can easily find a cultivar that offers better performance so you can still have those bright yellow plumes reminiscent of fireworks that thrive in a wide variety of conditions, from full sun to part-shade and in average to dry soils. Varieties to try: Zigzag, Seaside You've probably seen sumac listed in some of your favorite recipes: The dried, ground berries of this flower lend a sour, lemon-like flavor to plenty of savory dishes. In your garden, they're just as interesting to have around. Especially in the fall thanks to those clusters of short-stalked flowers and leaves that become extremely colorful! Note: This one can grow up to 30 feet tall!  Varieties to try: Lemonade Berry Sumac, Fragrant Sumac It's impossible not to love sunflowers! I mean, they're one of Ree Drummond's all-time favorite flowers for a reason as they provide cheery, larger-than-life charm in gardens all over the country. Though they peak in the summertime, they'll continue standing tall through the early autumn months. Check out our complete guide on how to grow sunflowers to liven up your space. Varieties to try: American Giant, Evening Sun SHOP SUNFLOWER SEEDS Well, if it isn't the star of autumn gardens! This iconic flower comes in every shade of the rainbow. Plus, they're hardy and cold-tolerant, so they'll come back next year if you get them in the ground early enough in the planting season. But fall-planted mums generally are considered annuals because their roots don't have time to establish before winter. That's okay! Enjoy them now and plant new ones next year using this guide on how to care for mums. Varieties to try:  Matchsticks, Mammoth Daisy Lavender  Here's another must-have for your autumn garden. Plant them in the summer and they'll bloom later in the season (around the same time as mums) when your other florals begin to fade. You'll get the prettiest blue, lavender, pink or purple shades for years to come. That's right! They're easy to grow and live a long time with little fuss from you, making them the perfect perennial for late-season color.  Varieties to try:  Bluebird, Peachie's Pick  Marigolds have been a fall favorite for a long time. You may even remember them from your grandmother's garden! That's because these hardy annuals bloom well into fall and can even survive a light frost. They aren't bothered by pests or critters either. You're sure to enjoy their reliable, steady hues in a perfect fall color palette. Just note: They come in a range of sizes from 6 to 18 inches tall, so read the label to be sure about what you’re getting.  Varieties to try:  Triple Treat, Strawberry Blonde  Smelling lightly of honey, these charming low-growing annuals look best cascading from window boxes and baskets. They also tolerate a light frost, so you'll enjoy the color and fragrance well into fall.  Varieties to try: Carpet of Snow, White Knight  When many other plants have faded, sedum offers lovely muted shades that contrast well with the vibrant colors of autumn. The cut blooms last for weeks in a vase.  Varieties to try: Lemonjade, Firecracker  SHOP SEDUMS Who says cabbage and kale can’t be pretty? These annuals have frilly edges and swirls of green and pink leaves in the center rosettes. They're as tough as nails and are gorgeous in the garden when mixed with other cool weather lovers, like pansies.  Varieties to try: Color Up Pink, Crane Pink  With their bright colors and adorable funny-face markings, these cool weather annuals enjoy the milder days of fall. In warm climates, they may make it through most of the winter, and some types self-sow to pop up again in your garden next spring.  Varieties to try:  Plentifall Frost, Johnny Jump-Up  These gorgeous flowers almost don’t look real! They come in tons of colors and also make great cut flowers. In northern gardens, you’ll need to dig up and save the tubers after the first frost kills the foliage, then replant in the spring.  Varieties to try: Eveline, Autumn Sunburst  These old favorites may not be the first flower that come to mind for autumn color, but they last all summer and are still going strong by the first frost. Keep them fed to ensure they’ll keep blooming, and enjoy them tumbling out of planters or window boxes. Look for newer types that don’t need deadheading to keep blooming.  Varieties to try: Carmine Velour Wave, Supercascade Blue  The silvery, fuzzy foliage of dusty miller provides a pretty contrast to the other autumn colors in the garden. Try this annual as a backdrop in mixed containers, or to edge your walkways. Varieties to try: Silver Lace, Silver Cascade  SHOP DUSTY MILLER This small shrub forms a neat mound that blooms in brilliant blue shades when everything else is winding down. Pollinators love caryopteris!   Varieties to try: Blue Diddley, Gold Crest  Zinnias are tough plants that come in every color you can imagine.

Varieties to try: Double Zahara Fire, Tequila Lime  Coleus have striking leaves ranging in color from lime green to deep burgundy with varying leaf shapes and heights. Some have striking variegated leaf patterns. They’re great for providing height in containers, and they also work as landscape plantings that keep their vivid colors until frost.  Varieties to try: Royale Cherry Brandy, Chocolate Splash  These beautiful shrubs start blooming in early to midsummer and keep on going all the way to a freeze. Their papery flowers stay intact, so they also provide winter interest when not much else is going on in the landscape. Hydrangeas grow in almost every climate, so read the label to find the correct one for your region.  Varieties to try: Cherry Explosion, Little Quickfire  Roses aren't as fussy as you may think. Shrub roses, also called landscape roses, bloom and bloom all the way until a freeze. Newer hybrids are more disease resistant and cold-hardy too, so you can enjoy them no matter where you live.

Nancy is a freelance writer for MarthaStewart.com. 
There's a way to keep your lush, flower-filled backyard garden intact but still have gorgeous blooms to make arrangements with: Plant an additional garden (called a cutting garden) and fill it with flowers that are meant to be displayed in a vase. You get the best of both worlds!
 
These plants can be annuals or perennials for a variety of options, says Teri Speight, a master gardener, writer, podcaster, blogger, and the author of Black Flora: Profiles of Inspiring Black Flower Farmers and Florists. "With a diverse selection of plant material, a cutting garden can offer not just blooms, but foliage, as well," she says. Here's how to choose the best location for your cutting garden, along which flowers, herbs, and plants are the best to grow, according to experts.
 
Before choosing you flowers, you'll need to figure out where to plant them so your garden will flourish. There are a few factors that make for a great cut flower garden location: access to sunlight, a well-drained area, and healthy soil, say Jennifer and Adam O'Neal, the owners of PepperHarrow Farm and co-authors of Small Farm, Big Dreams: Turning A Flower-Growing Passion into a Successful Floral Business.
 
The first step is to find a location in your yard that receives adequate sunlight. "Most cut flowers prefer full sun, so picking a spot that achieves at least six hours of sunlight per day is ideal," say the O'Neals. This will also satisfy any cut flowers that require partial sun, they add. (Be sure to check the back of the seed packets for sunlight requirements.)
 
It's also important to find a well-drained area that won't hold rain water. "Flowers don't like to be kept overly moist, and too much water, especially standing water, will impede your flowers from growing and thriving," say the O'Neals. "If you're dealing with areas like this, the best thing you can do is to actively work on ways to help excess water drain away from the location."
 
The O'Neals recommend adding compost to your soil, constructing french drains, or building the area up slightly and adding raised bed gardens to help the water drain away from your cut flower garden.
 
A cutting garden also needs fertile, workable soil (typically topsoil and compost). "The first thing we always recommend is having a soil test completed for the location you're looking to add a cut flower garden," say the O'Neals. "Obtaining a soil test will help you to determine what nutrients you might be missing in your soil, so you can add those missing nutrients back into the soil."
 
When choosing flowers, consider a mix of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures (this allows for the most striking arrangements!), says Adam Dooling, the curator of Outdoor Garden and Herbaceous Collections at the New York Botanical Garden in Bronx, N.Y. To make it even more eye-catching, add in some foliage such as hosta leaves, as well as ferns and ornamental grasses. "Beyond aesthetics and fragrance, there are some objective qualities that make for a good cut, such as long, strong stems and a good 'vase life'—meaning, the amount of time a cut flower will still look good and retain its appearance in a vase," says Dooling.
 
Zinnias come in a variety of colors and grow large blooms. With full sun access, these flowers can reach up to 4 inches in height. "This is a flower we recommend giving a 'pinch' when they reach 12 to 18 inches tall to promote branching and flowering on the plant," say the O'Neals. "The more you cut zinnias, the more blooms they produce."
 
Do note that you should cut a zinnia when it's fully mature. The best way to tell that it's reached this point is by giving it a wiggle test, they say. Bounce the stem between your index and middle finger, and if the stem is rigid, it's ready to be cut. When the stem is floppy, it's not ready to cut and won't stand up straight in the vase. After cutting your zinnias, they will last for about seven to 10 days, however, they are known as a "dirty" flower, say the O'Neals. "Their stems are hairy, so they make vase water murky quickly," they say. "We recommend changing the water for a vase with these flowers once a day, retrimming the bottom of the stems each time."
 
When exposed to full sun, the celosia, specifically Celosia argantea, will grow vibrant, feathery blooms, which the O'Neals say are a great filler in bouquets. "This type of celosia can be pinched at 18 inches if you want to keep it a bit shorter," they say. Like zinnias, make sure the stem is rigid before cutting.
 
For a beautiful blue bloom, consider growing salvias. The Salvia blue bedder is a favorite of the O'Neals, and it can be grown as a perennial in zones 8 to 10. "Salvia serves as a supporting filler and adds a striking pop of color in a bouquet," they say. "Salvia is a bloom we give the wiggle test to, to see if it's mature to cut."
 
Some of the best peony varieties to grow for cutting are Paeonia lactiflora 'Vogue,' Coral Charm, and 'Baroness Schroeder,' says Speight. "Herbaceous peonies should be planted in the fall where they rise from the earth the following spring," she says. While peonies can take a growing season or two to bloom, they will grow in a variety of colorful hues.
 
Producing daisy-like flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, cosmos are another great cutting flower, say the O'Neals. "Their blooms are incredibly delicate and add the sparkle element to a bouquet," they say.
 
While they need full sun and typically grow in the 32- to 48-inch range, cosmos can be kept at a shorter length when they are pinched at 18 inches (this promotes branching!). "Cut blooms from them regularly, or remove old blooms to promote flowering," say the O'Neals. "Cosmos should be cut when the first petal is just beginning to curl open to give them the maximum vase life."
 
These flowers grow in shades of blush, orange, red, white, and yellow, and produce paper-like petals. Since they bloom into different shapes, the O'Neals love using this as a "filler flower" in an arrangement. These can be grown as annuals in zones 2 to 7 and as perennials in zones 8 to 10. "We give strawflowers the wiggle test to make sure the bloom is mature to cut," they say. "When cut at the proper stage, strawflowers can have a vase life from seven to 10 days."
 
There are many perks to the everlasting daisy. "Also known as Rhodanthe chlorocephala, [this] is an old-fashioned cut flower that can also be used as an everlasting (meaning you can dry the blooms for use in arrangements later)," says Speight. "The paper-like blooms should be harvested when partially opened. They will finish opening after harvesting within the arrangement."
 
They might not be an obvious choice, but herbs, like apple mint or cinnamon basil, are perfect to include in an arrangement. "They serve as greenery in a bouquet that provides an interesting texture and adds a lovely fragrance," say the O'Neals. "These herbs make a cut flower garden even more inviting."
 
For apple mint, consider planting in a container since they will spread if they are placed in your garden. This variety typically grows up to 36 inches in height and grows well as a perennial. Cinnamon basil can grow right in your garden and reach between 18 to 24 inches in height. This basil thrives in zones 5 to 8 as an annual, and grows best in zones 9 to 10 as a perennial. "We often wait to harvest basil until it begins to go to seed, and it also likes to be harvested early in the morning before the heat of the day sets in," say the O'Neals. "The vase life for both of these is about seven to 10 days."
 
For another filler in an arrangement, consider adding ferns to your cutting garden. These typically need part shade to thrive in the garden. Once you cut and add to a bouquet or tabletop display, the greenery will add fullness, especially alongside taller plants, says Speight. "In particular, the Japanese Painted Fern (Athyrium niponicum) adds a silvery tone that can balance, blend, and soften arrangements as needed," she says. "This particular cultivar grows easily in semi-shaded and damp areas." Ferns typically last as long as the rest of the arrangement, typically between seven to 10 days, as long as it stays hydrated.
 
When your garden is in full bloom, here are some tips for cutting and arranging your flowers, herbs, and plants to make beautiful bouquets.
 
With a few exceptions, like dahlias and zinnias that should be cut when in full bloom, the flowers should be cut when color begins to appear on their buds, says Dooling. If you don't have floral snips, use a sharp knife or scissors to get the job done. It's best to cut the flowers in the morning when it's still cool, rather than when it's hot in the afternoon or evening.
 
To keep cut flowers fresh as long as possible, start by putting them in a clean vase. Remove any leaves that fall below the water line in your vase, since those are what cause bacteria to grow, says Dooling.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: If you’re looking for the best flowers that offer vibrant color all summer long, check out these dozen no-fail, flowering plants. No doubt you’ve heard that a well-designed garden should include plants prized for their striking foliage, as well as some that produce fall color or berries, and others that provide good structure in winter. But let’s face it: most of us want flowers. Lots of them. All the time.  That’s where the summer flowering plants below come in. They’ll churn out blooms for weeks on end this summer. In most cases, you can harvest armloads to fill vases or give away, and still have plenty left to enjoy in your garden beds long past Labor Day. Related Also known as rose-mallow and swamp hibiscus, this garden standout was bred from wildflowers native to the East and South. Huge red, pink or white flowers can be as much as a foot across on stems that range from 2 to 8 feet high, depending on the variety. Flowers bloom from late spring until frost. Stems die back to the ground each winter. Care: Requires full sun; regular to abundant water. Grows as a perennial in zones 5-10. Before 1995, when this hybrid was named an All-America Selection winner, gardeners thought of petunias as upright plants. Purple Wave petunias (and later Wave introductions in pinks and lilac) are more like vines—perfect for growing in hanging pots, along retaining walls or even as a ground cover. Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Grows as an annual in all zones. Grow zinnias if you want to be able to cut armloads of flowers for bouquets and still have a bright band of color alongside a path or a lawn. All zinnias thrive in hot weather, but Profusion zinnias keep on blooming well into fall, whatever the weather.  Profusion White, Orange and Cherry, which have daisy-like flowers, each have won multiple garden awards. If you want fluffy pom-poms, look for double Profusion varieties in cherry, gold, white and “fire,” an orange-red. Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Grows as an annual in all zones. For year-round enjoyment, these clover-like flower heads are hard to beat. The papery flowers last a long time in the garden and in fresh bouquets, and the blooms are easy to dry for use in wintertime arrangements. Depending on the variety, flowers are white, red, pink, lilac or purple. ‘Strawberry Fields,’ with bright red blossoms, and ‘All Around Purple’ are two standouts. Care: Requires full sun to partial shade; moderate water. Grows as an annual in all zones. If you want to add contrast to a flowerbed or to fresh or dried flower arrangements, this dramatic spiky plant is a great choice. It resembles thistle, but the flower colors blend in more with the prickly blue-green leaves, which are often streaked with silver. Alpine sea holly (E. alpinum) is a deep steel blue, while E. amethystinum is more silvery blue. Miss Willmott’s Ghost (E. giganteum) produces especially striking conical flowers, each surrounded by a wreath of silvery, spikey bracts. Care: Requires full sun; moderate to regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 3-8. Tough and trouble-free, daylilies produce showy flowers above a mound of sword-shaped leaves. Whether in the garden or in a vase, each blossom lasts just one day; they are daylilies, after all. But each stem holds numerous buds that open on successive days. Low-growing Stella de Oro keeps churning out new stems with a profusion of golden-yellow blossoms for up to five months, far longer than most daylilies.  Care: Requires full sun to light shade; regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 3-9. Small clusters of delicate white flowers appear in low-growing clumps in spring and continue into the fall. The shiny, dark-green leaves stay on all winter, so the plant remains attractive year-round.  Care: Requires full sun to part shade; regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 5-9. Brilliant yellow or orange flowers with a raised brown polka-dot center stand out in a perennial border. R. hirta varieties bloom from seed the first year and are grown as annuals; in the warmest areas, they’re wintertime bloomers.  Most other kinds are perennial and gradually form showy, spreading clumps as hardy as their wildflower ancestors, native to the East. All are good cut flowers as well. One to search out: R. fulgida var. sullivantii ‘Goldsturm,’ an especially flower-covered variety.  Care: Requires full sun; moderate to regular water. Grows as an annual or perennial, depending on the variety (as noted), in all zones. Despite the scary name, this is a lovely wildflower native to our Eastern meadows that draws butterflies and birds. One especially showy variety, E. maculatum ‘Gateway,’ has wine-red stems 5 to 7 feet tall, topped by dusky rose nosegays a foot across. Use as a tall anchor in a perennial bed or as a temporary screen, since stems die back to the ground in winter.  Care: Requires full sun; average to abundant water. Grows as a perennial in zones 4-8. Pink to purple daisy-like flowers about 4 inches across cover this perennial from mid-summer into autumn. The plant is especially hardy and unfussy, and you can divide clumps after several years to get new plants. The flowers draw butterflies and last well as cut flowers. ‘PowWow Wild Berry,’ which has rosy pink flowers, has been chosen as an All-America Selections winner. With large, easy-to-plant seeds and magnificently showy flowers, sunflowers are perhaps the perfect flower for kids to grow. Classic single-stem kinds such as ‘Mammoth Russian’ and ‘Russian Giant’ grow 10-15 feet tall and produce plate-size flowers with edible seeds.  Newer, shorter kinds include ‘Ring of Fire,” which is about 4-5 feet tall and has 5-inch flowers that work in a vase, and ‘Sunspot,’ which grows just 2 feet tall. ‘Indian Blanket’ is a branching kind with numerous smaller flowers suitable for cutting. Sunflower blooms face the sun, so choose a bed where the sun will be behind you.  Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Most grow as annuals in all zones. These perky yellow or orange flowers really light up a garden bed. The plant’s distinctive (should we say strong?) odor also keeps pests away. Marigolds are great as cut flowers, too. ‘Moonsong Deep Orange,’ a hybrid that has been named an All-America Selection winner, has frilly, densely packed flowers. But many other marigolds look more like daisies, with just a row or two of petals around a dark center.  Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Grows as an annual in all zones.

Depending on the variety, flowers are white, red, pink, lilac or purple. ‘Strawberry Fields,’ with bright red blossoms, and ‘All Around Purple’ are two standouts. Care: Requires full sun to partial shade; moderate water. Grows as an annual in all zones. If you want to add contrast to a flowerbed or to fresh or dried flower arrangements, this dramatic spiky plant is a great choice. It resembles thistle, but the flower colors blend in more with the prickly blue-green leaves, which are often streaked with silver. Alpine sea holly (E. alpinum) is a deep steel blue, while E. amethystinum is more silvery blue. Miss Willmott’s Ghost (E. giganteum) produces especially striking conical flowers, each surrounded by a wreath of silvery, spikey bracts. Care: Requires full sun; moderate to regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 3-8. Tough and trouble-free, daylilies produce showy flowers above a mound of sword-shaped leaves. Whether in the garden or in a vase, each blossom lasts just one day; they are daylilies, after all. But each stem holds numerous buds that open on successive days. Low-growing Stella de Oro keeps churning out new stems with a profusion of golden-yellow blossoms for up to five months, far longer than most daylilies.  Care: Requires full sun to light shade; regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 3-9. Small clusters of delicate white flowers appear in low-growing clumps in spring and continue into the fall. The shiny, dark-green leaves stay on all winter, so the plant remains attractive year-round.  Care: Requires full sun to part shade; regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 5-9. Brilliant yellow or orange flowers with a raised brown polka-dot center stand out in a perennial border. R. hirta varieties bloom from seed the first year and are grown as annuals; in the warmest areas, they’re wintertime bloomers.  Most other kinds are perennial and gradually form showy, spreading clumps as hardy as their wildflower ancestors, native to the East. All are good cut flowers as well. One to search out: R. fulgida var. sullivantii ‘Goldsturm,’ an especially flower-covered variety.  Care: Requires full sun; moderate to regular water. Grows as an annual or perennial, depending on the variety (as noted), in all zones. Despite the scary name, this is a lovely wildflower native to our Eastern meadows that draws butterflies and birds. One especially showy variety, E. maculatum ‘Gateway,’ has wine-red stems 5 to 7 feet tall, topped by dusky rose nosegays a foot across. Use as a tall anchor in a perennial bed or as a temporary screen, since stems die back to the ground in winter.  Care: Requires full sun; average to abundant water. Grows as a perennial in zones 4-8. Pink to purple daisy-like flowers about 4 inches across cover this perennial from mid-summer into autumn. The plant is especially hardy and unfussy, and you can divide clumps after several years to get new plants. The flowers draw butterflies and last well as cut flowers. ‘PowWow Wild Berry,’ which has rosy pink flowers, has been chosen as an All-America Selections winner. With large, easy-to-plant seeds and magnificently showy flowers, sunflowers are perhaps the perfect flower for kids to grow. Classic single-stem kinds such as ‘Mammoth Russian’ and ‘Russian Giant’ grow 10-15 feet tall and produce plate-size flowers with edible seeds.  Newer, shorter kinds include ‘Ring of Fire,” which is about 4-5 feet tall and has 5-inch flowers that work in a vase, and ‘Sunspot,’ which grows just 2 feet tall. ‘Indian Blanket’ is a branching kind with numerous smaller flowers suitable for cutting. Sunflower blooms face the sun, so choose a bed where the sun will be behind you.  Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Most grow as annuals in all zones. These perky yellow or orange flowers really light up a garden bed. The plant’s distinctive (should we say strong?) odor also keeps pests away. Marigolds are great as cut flowers, too. ‘Moonsong Deep Orange,’ a hybrid that has been named an All-America Selection winner, has frilly, densely packed flowers. But many other marigolds look more like daisies, with just a row or two of petals around a dark center.  Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Grows as an annual in all zones.

 The most beautiful flowers in the world 
Verdissimo World
 Verdissimo | Curiosities | The most beautiful flowers in the world What do you think is the most beautiful flower in the world? Nature often surprises us with true wonders. There are the flowers that can leave anybody speechless. In this post, from Verdissimo, the leading producer of preserved flowers and plants, we’ll reveal some of the most beautiful flowers in the world  in the following list: roses, hydrangeas, bleeding hearts, cherry blossoms, orchids, tulips, peonies, lilies, freesias, lotus flowers, tuberoses, dahlias, chrysanthemums, carnations and morning glories. Below, we’ll show you images of each one of these beautiful flowers and tell you all the most important details. Index  The rose is considered the most beautiful flower in the world, which is why it’s called the “queen of the garden.” It’s one of the most popular flowers worldwide, and it comes in different sizes and colors. Also, they’re very common throughout the world. These flowers work well for decorating events, making perfumes… and much more!  This flower is originally from Southern Asia and also is very popular worldwide. It has undeniable beauty and is commonly used in decoration. Also, the hydrangea is an ideal flower for creating bouquets, since it provides lots of volume and texture. The “bleeding-heart” flower, actually called Dicentra, is one of the most striking flowers in the world. In spite of being unique and amazing, it’s relatively unknown. This flower, like the hydrangea, is originally from Asia and can be found naturally in several colors: red, fuchsia, light pink, etc. The cherry blossom, although not the official flower, is one of the most important flowers in Japanese culture. Trees that produce this flower are known as sakura. Like previous flowers, the cherry blossom can be found in different colors naturally, though its most common colors are pink and white.  The orchid is a lovely flower that is often used in decoration and also as a gift. It’s an unusual flower that is easily identified by the shape of its leaves.

Americans spend thousands of dollars each year on floral arrangements without realizing that almost anyone can grow beautiful flowers; all you need is some soil, a packet of seeds, and a potting container or patch of ground.
 
Here are 30 of the world's prettiest flowering plants to consider growing in your garden beds or containers. The list includes spring-blooming bulbs, annuals, perennials, exotic imports, and native wildflowers.
 Lilies, irises, daffodils, and foxglove are listed on Poison Control's poisonous plant list. Birds of paradise, tulips, and wisteria are also known to have toxic properties. Notice the USDA hardiness zone for each plant to make sure it is hardy in your climate. If it's not hardy in your area, consider growing the plant as an annual and discard it at the end of the season or grow it in a container that you can move indoors to overwinter.

Take the inherent beauty of the orchid, and add fantastic speckling and unusual anatomy. You will recognize one of the dozen or so species of the Zygopetalum genus of orchids. Unlike many orchids, the zygopetalum is also very fragrant. Put this robust grower in a hanging basket under the dappled shade of a tree to give it the best lighting conditions. Grow in partial shade in humid conditions, and protect from hot summer temperatures and freezing temperatures.

English roses like the 'Abraham Darby' variety shown here are revered for their large blooms packed with petals and old-world fragrance. Many of the most beloved English roses (Rosa) come from the David Austin breeding program, where roses undergo an eight-year trial to identify the most outstanding garden varieties. Grow these zone 5 to 9 plants in full sun in rich loam, and fertilize once in spring and summer.

Some people automatically think of giant dinner plate-sized blooms at the mention of dahlias, but the Dahlia genus includes a huge diversity of plant and bloom size and flower forms. Choose a variety that has the potential to produce mammoth blooms, like the 'Kevin Floodlight' dinner plate dahlia pictured here. Dahlias require full sun and plenty of fertilizer and water. If you wish, you can remove most of the buds to direct the plant's energy into producing only a few huge blooms. Dinner plate dahlias need a long time to mature and might require a head start indoors north of hardiness zone 5.

So many features of the Turkscap lily (Lilium martagon) make it unique: the impressive four-foot stalks, the pendant-like shape of each blossom, and the profusion of blooms on each stem. Much less common in the trade than Oriental or Asiatic lilies, martagon lilies like their feet in the shade and flowers in the sun in USDA hardiness zones 3 to 8. They need a sheltered spot where they won't be subjected to wind and require excellent drainage. The variety 'R.O. Backhouse' pictured here features pink buds that open to gold flowers dusted with purple freckles.

Although the exotic-looking toad lily (Tryicyrtis hirta) seems like a tender tropical plant, this shade-loving perennial is surprisingly hardy. The fall bloomers can grow in zone 4, which includes the northern U.S., and will slowly multiply in moist soils.
 When planting in the garden, make sure you mark where you have sown seeds and planted seedlings. Also, keep the seed packet or plant tag included with nursery transplants for easy reference for care instructions or the specific requirements. The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova 
Bumblebees flock to foxglove and love them so dearly they sometimes spend the night in the tubular blossoms so they can get an early start when the sun rises. Foxglove blooms are shaped like glove-like bells and come in various colors and unique patterns that make quite a statement when planted in groups.
 
These plants are biennial in zones 4-8, meaning they produce foliage their first year and flower the next. However, when self-seeding begins in partial shade and moist soil, you will always have one generation of plants ready to bloom while the next generation grows foliage and prepares to bloom next year. Try 'Mountains Mixed,' which has upright-facing flowers. Be aware that all parts of this plant are toxic to humans and animals.

The name says it all. While there aren't any unattractive peonies (Paeonia), 'Bowl of Beauty' pictured here is the perfect marriage of color and form. The large circumference of fuchsia guard petals surrounds a frilly lemon center of petals, which creates the bowl. Peonies don't ask for much in their decades of life: full sun and good drainage are enough to produce masses of blooms in average fertile soil. Peonies are exceptionally hardy, to zone 3 and 4, giving northern gardeners something to look forward to after a grueling winter.

 Cut edible flowers early in the morning when the flavors are most intense. To store them, put the flowers in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. They should last for a couple of days.  The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova 
Although non-native wisteria varieties like Chinese wisteria (Wisteria sinensis) have an invasive reputation in the garden, a well-maintained native wisteria vine (Wisteria frutescens or Wisteria macrostachya) in full bloom looks luscious with its stunning, sweet-smelling flowers. Prune and train them over a sturdy structure like an arbor or gazebo, as most trellises can't do the job. Vines are hardy to zone 5.

The late spring blooming parrot tulip is a truly unique and whimsical plant thanks to its eye-catching variety of twisted, ruffled, or curled petals drenched in vivid color combinations. They resemble the colorful feathers of the tropical bird they are named for. Parrot tulips are not long-lived bulbs, so many gardeners treat them as annuals
 The Spruce / Gyscha Rendy 
The pretty blooms of this shrub appear late in the summer season when the rest of the garden is beginning to fade. The exotic trumpet flowers come in many colors, and varieties, such as tropical hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), a hardy variety, or rose of Sharon (Hibiscus syriacus)—the last two are better for colder climates. These flowers are attractive to butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds.
 The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova 
The showy blooms of the Japanese camellia (Camellia japonica) are the state flower of Alabama, a popular flower in the southern U.S. There are more than 3,000 types of camellias; most are slow-growing. The delicately layered petals are used in perfumes for their sweet fragrance. The blooms are popular with pollinating visitors. Deer don't seem to favor the flower, but young buds interest the grazers.

                 You hear it so often, it’s a cliché. “I want to grow beautiful flowers for my garden, but everything I plant dies.” Dead outdoor plants can happen for many reasons. Sometimes, we plant flowers for the garden that need more sun or shade than we can give them, or there's a drought, or pests and diseases move in and send our poor dahlias, roses and other flowering plants to the compost pile. Instead of trying to grow needy outdoor plants, opt for some easy flowers to grow, such as sunflowers and morning glories. You can find easy-care flowering perennials for season-long color, and, when they're finished, fill in with annual flowers for year-round color. Read on for more "can't-kill flowers" for beginners to grow. Plant them in full sun to part shade, and carefree Siberian irises will bloom in early summer. After the flowers finish, don't remove the leaves. They'll soak up the sun to power the next season's blooms and die back naturally. In the meantime, they'll add texture to the garden. You can find Siberian iris in many colors, including purple, blue, gold, pink, white and burgundy. Give them moist soil, and they'll grow 34 inches tall by 18 to 24 inches across. They're hardy perennials in USDA Zones 3 to 9. Portulaca, or moss rose, is a tough annual that grows happily in full sun and average, well-draining soil. This succulent has thick leaves, so it can tolerate some drought. Use its colorful carpet of blooms as a groundcover or grow portulaca as a bedding plant. This variety, 'Mojave', is a mix of cheerful red, pink, tangerine orange and yellow flowers. It's easy to grow from seed, but don't transplant it into your garden until after your last spring frost. Although catmint is an ornamental relative to catnip, its unscented leaves are less likely to attract felines to your garden. (Bees and butterflies love them, though.) This is an easy-to-grow, perennial herb valued for its lavender-blue flowers and gray-green foliage. Catmint doesn't mind drought, heat or average soil and thrives in full sun to part shade. It grows so easily, that it can invade other areas. You may want to grow it in pots or put edging around it. Shown here: Catmint (Nepeta x faassenii) 'Purrsian Blue'. 'Shock-O-Lat' is a sunflower with giant flowerheads and lots of branches. The blooms are the deep, dark brown color of a chocolate bar, and they're highlighted with golden tips. A gold halo circles each center disk, too. Although each flower is slightly different in coloration, all are pollen-free, so they're fine for vases. This variety tops out at about 6 feet high.

 Native New England asters hit their stride from late summer into fall, when they bloom in shades that range from deep purple to lavender and pink. These undemanding beauties, which are wildflowers, perform in full sun to partial shade and can grow to 6 feet tall. Try them in a meadow, where they'll attract bees and butterflies. They're perennials in Zones 3 to 8. Look for zinnias in almost every color except blue; they're also available in a variety of heights. The flowers may look like daisies or dahlias, spiders or pom poms and more. Plant them in the sun and space them as directed on the seed packet or label; good air circulation helps prevent disease.

 Cheerful marigolds are easy to grow in sunny spots, brightening your garden with shades of yellow, red and gold as they bloom all summer long. African or American type marigolds grow 3 to 5 feet tall, but you can find shorter and more compact varieties. Pansies (Viola x wittrockiana) add color to your garden while the weather is cool, in spring and fall. They'll even overwinter in some regions if they're mulched for protection. Give these undemanding little plants sun and soil that drains easily.

 Impatiens ask little more than a shady spot and enough water to keep them from wilting. Plant these pretty annuals when the weather is reliably warm. In recent years, many impatiens (I. walleriana) have succumbed to downy mildew. 'Big Bounce' (pictured) is a new hybrid for shade to partial sun that resists this deadly disease. You'll also find disease-resistant impatiens in the 'Bounce' series. Tough, can't-kill summer begonias like 'Surefire Rose' are great for hanging baskets, containers or garden beds. Give them sun or shade and they'll reward you with lots of lush color.

 Bring butterflies to your beginner's garden with pink and cream snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus) like ‘Twinny Appleblossom’. These plants bloom heavily and stand up to the often harsh weather in spring and fall. Plant daffodil bulbs and stand back. They'll burst into bloom each spring, filling your garden with color and fragrance. Give these hardy bulbs a sunny or partly sunny home in the garden or in containers; they're best planted in the fall. Add cosmos plants to your garden or grow these daisy-like flowers from seeds. These annuals are so undemanding, they'll bloom even in poor soils. They like full sun (but appreciate afternoon shade in hot climates) and tolerate drought once they're up and growing.

 Great in window boxes, hanging baskets, pots or the garden, geraniums are low-maintenance plants. Grow these perky flowers for color from spring until frost; they prefer full sun, but may need some afternoon shade in hot regions. To help morning glory seeds sprout, soak them in tepid water the night before you plant or file the hard seed coat to open it. Once they're started, morning glories can take care of themselves. But because they drop their seeds and self-sow readily, be careful where you plant them or you'll be pulling volunteers for years! To help control unwanted seedlings, mow, rake or heavily mulch the ground underneath the plants.

 Blanket flowers (Gaillardia) are native wildflowers in parts of the U.S., and they grow robustly in full sun. These butterfly magnets bloom from early summer into fall. These sun-loving perennials bloom dependably in almost any kind of soil, as long as it drains easily. Best of all, you can divide them after a time and expand your garden.

 Grow these low-maintenance lovelies from seed or starts. Calendulas are said to lure aphids away from vegetable plants, so if you’re using them as insect traps, grow extras as ornamentals. They thrive in full to part sun and tolerate heat. 'Lady Godiva' comes in orange, shown here, and yellow. Put out a buffet for hummingbirds and other pollinators with salvia. Pictured here, 'Amistad' is an award-winner with deep purple flowers and near-black bracts. Once salvia plants are established, they're forgiving if you forget to water now and then.

 Plant low-maintenance Echinaceas, or coneflowers, in the spring. This compact variety, Sombrero Poco Yellow, loves full sun and tolerates some drought. Colors in the Sombrero series include red, pink, coral, white and orange. Achillea is sometimes called common yarrow. The variety 'Firefly Peach Sky' is uncommonly easy to grow in full sun from summer into early fall. Yarrow grows well in average and even poor soils, as long as it has good drainage. Nearly carefree columbines come in yellow, orange, red, purple and bi-colors. Plant them in sun or light shade for flowers into early summer. Periods of drought don't bother them. 'Songbird Cardinal' columbine has upturned blooms, rather than the usual nodding flowers, so you — and hummingbirds — can see them more easily. Start phlox in the spring, and the fragrant flowers will open into late summer. This easy-to-grow perennial, Super Ka-Pow Fuchsia, stays compact and takes full sun. Plants in this series also come in lavender, white, coral and pink. Dianthus are undemanding beauties for sunny beds, containers and borders. Dianthus Mountain Frost Ruby Glitter attracts butterflies to its sweetly scented blooms from spring to frost. Once the plants are established, they can tolerate drought. Mountain Frost dianthus are also available in pink, rose and bi-colors.

After the flowers finish, don&#x27;t remove the leaves. They&#x27;ll soak up the sun to power the next season&#x27;s blooms and die back naturally. In the meantime, they&#x27;ll add texture to the garden. You can find Siberian iris in many colors, including purple, blue, gold, pink, white and burgundy. Give them moist soil, and they&#x27;ll grow 34 inches tall by 18 to 24 inches across. They&#x27;re hardy perennials in USDA Zones 3 to 9.

It grows so easily, that it can invade other areas. You may want to grow it in pots or put edging around it. Shown here: Catmint (Nepeta x faassenii) &#x27;Purrsian Blue&#x27;. &#x27;Shock-O-Lat&#x27; is a sunflower with giant flowerheads and lots of branches. The blooms are the deep, dark brown color of a chocolate bar, and they&#x27;re highlighted with golden tips. A gold halo circles each center disk, too. Although each flower is slightly different in coloration, all are pollen-free, so they&#x27;re fine for vases. This variety tops out at about 6 feet high.

 Bring the scent and colour of your garden inside using cut flower displays
            Image: Shutterstock You can save a fortune on cut flowers if you grow your own, but considering the enormous choice out there, deciding what to grow can be tricky. To set the ball rolling, we’ve shared ten blooms that look equally lovely in the garden or a vase. If you’re looking to brighten up your home, here’s our ‘pick’ of the best ten cut flowers to grow: Read on to find out why each of these varieties won a coveted spot in our top ten. And for even more inspiration, browse our full range of colourful flower seeds here. Sweet peas are excellent value for money - the more you pick, the more will grow
            Image: Sweet Pea 'Scent Infusion' from Thompson & Morgan The ultimate 'cut and come again' cut flower, sweet peas used to be a popular glasshouse variety but are now mainly grown in the garden. There are plenty of colours to choose from, but a good mix of shades makes the prettiest posies.  Old fashioned grandiflora types often have the best scent - try Sweet Pea 'Scent Infusion' for fragrant and colourful blooms that are ideal for regular picking. Benefiting from a long, robust stem, this sweet pea is a joy to see growing up your garden trellis or obelisk, but also looks divine as an informal display indoors. Cut the flowers just as the lowest bloom is opening and put them in water immediately for a longer vase life. Ideal for allergy sufferers, Tree Lily 'Crystal Collection' is completely pollen free
            Image: Visions BV, Netherlands Oriental lilies are a top choice for fragrance and glamorous trumpet shaped blooms. You only need a few stems to make a dramatic and exotic-looking cut flower display, and there are lots of different lilies that can be grown as a cut flower.  The only problem with these wonderful flowers is that their pollen can stain clothes. To solve this issue, try gently removing the stamens from lilies as they open or grow sterile, double varieties like Tree Lily 'Crystal Collection' which are completely pollen free. Remember, when cutting lily stems from the garden it's important to leave a third of the stem intact in order to feed the bulb for the following year. Including a very unusual pink shade, 'Harlequin' produces multi-headed stems of pollen-free blooms
            Image: Sunflower 'Harlequin' from Thompson & Morgan Sunflowers make the cheeriest cut flowers and never fail to raise a smile. They're very easy to grow and won't require any special attention - simply sow your sunflower seeds directly into the ground where you want them to flower.  For cutting, it's best to choose multi-headed varieties such as Sunflower 'Harlequin' to give you lots of blooms. Cut the stems just before the flowers fully open, and strip the lower foliage from the stem leaving just a few leaves at the top to help fill out your bouquet. Use sharp secateurs to cut sunflowers early in the morning or in the evening when it’s cool.  Tulip 'Everlasting' Mixture blooms from the first year
            Image: Tulip 'Everlasting' Mixture from Thompson & Morgan For an early blaze of colour, plant lots of tulip bulbs so that you’ll be able to cut plenty for your home without denting your garden display. Cut tulips are thirsty flowers so keep an eye on the fluid level in your vase and be sure to avoid mixing your cut tulips with daffodils. Narcissus species exude a substance that prevents your tulips (and other cut flowers) from taking up water.  Tulips come in such a beguiling range of colours that you’ll be spoiled for choice. That’s why we love Tulip 'Everlasting' Mixture. Sturdy and colourful, they’re guaranteed to flower the first year you plant them, and of course, they’ll come back time after time.  Gladiolus 'Tango' provides exotic colour and structure
            Image: Gladiolus 'Tango' from Thompson & Morgan The flamboyant, tall stems of Gladioli are superb for adding height and drama to flower arrangements. There are plenty to choose from but our favourite is a modern hybrid - Gladiolus 'Tango'. Its exquisite, ruffled, mauve pink blooms make such wonderful cut flowers. Cut gladioli flowers just as the lowest two or three florets begin to open, but try to leave as many leaves as possible to feed the bulb for next year. Gladioli flowers will generally all reach maturity at about the same time, but if you want to prolong the cutting season, plant at two week intervals so that they mature over a longer period. These individual, exquisitely formed blooms are a classic cut flower
            Image: Rose 'Breeders Choice Pink' from Thompson & Morgan No list of recommendations for cut flowers would be complete without a rose. Growing these beautiful blooms for cut flowers takes a little more work than growing them as garden shrubs, but the results are well worth the effort. Choose varieties carefully to ensure the nicest form and longest stems. And when growing roses for cut flowers, be ruthless and remove any poorly placed flower buds to direct energy into the best blooms. For our top pick, we’re going for hybrid tea rose 'Breeders Choice Pink'. Each stem of this nicely-branched rose bush bears an individual, perfectly formed, stunning pink rose bloom. What more can you ask from a cut flower? With a naturally compact and bushy growth habit, Eucalyptus gunnii 'Azura' is good for small gardens
            Image: Eucalyptus gunnii 'Azura' from Thompson & Morgan The silvery-blue foliage of eucalyptus gunnii makes it a fantastic filler for vases, bouquets, and larger flower arrangements. We particularly love Eucalyptus gunnii 'Azura' for its attractive, rounded, silver-blue leaves that provide shape and texture for formal and relaxed displays. Eucalyptus has a sensational vase life, easily lasting more than 3 weeks, and is often the 'last man standing' in any vase. Florists use the juvenile foliage of Eucalyptus which is more rounded and attractive than that found on mature plants. Grow your Eucalyptus as a coppiced plant, pruning hard each year to encourage a constant supply of immature stems for cutting. Dianthus 'Rainbow Loveliness Improved Mixed' has unique blooms with deeply cut, feathery petals
            Image: Dianthus 'Rainbow Loveliness Improved Mixed' from Thompson & Morgan Dianthus, the family of plants which includes Carnations, Pinks and Sweet Williams, boasts some of the best known of all cut flowers. Dianthus 'Scented Mix' provides traditional flowers, but it's worth trying something different if you’re growing your own flowers for cutting.  Our top choice is Dianthus 'Rainbow Loveliness Improved Mixed' which we love for its unusual feathery blooms. Regular cutting will help to ensure a long flowering season, but do avoid standing carnation arrangements in direct light or they will quickly fade. These large blooms have a powerful scent, and layer upon layer of sublime, shell pink petals
            Image: Peony 'Eden's Perfume' from Thompson & Morgan Peonies are prized for their beautiful, large blooms. Just a few stems are enough to create a stunning arrangement, which is good because it’s best to use restraint when growing peonies as cut flowers. Take just a few blooms from each plant and avoid cutting stems from those that are less than three years old, or the plant can suffer. The flowers from herbaceous peonies like Peony 'Eden's Perfume' should be cut just before they open, when the buds feel soft between your finger and thumb. Cutting double peonies too early may prevent the buds from opening, so it's worth being patient with them. Single flowered peonies can be cut at a slightly less advanced stage if necessary, while the buds are swollen but still firm. The delicate flowers and foliage of gypsophila look splendid in a vase
            Image: Gypsophila elegans 'Covent Garden' from Thompson & Morgan Delicate and graceful Gypsophila is particularly useful as a filler for softening bouquets and adding a frothy haze of tiny blooms to your cut flower arrangements. This well-loved cut flower can be sown outdoors into its final position each spring. To prolong the flowering season and provide you with plenty of blooms, stagger your sowings. We love Gypsophila elegans 'Covent Garden' which has white or pink edible flowers with a mild, slightly sweet flavour. Before cutting each stem it's best to wait until most of the flowers on the stem have opened. Keep vases away from fruit bowls. Like many flowers, Gypsophila is particularly sensitive to ethylene given off by fruit and vegetables which causes cut flowers to deteriorate faster. We hope you’ve enjoyed our pick of the best cut flowers to grow at home.
