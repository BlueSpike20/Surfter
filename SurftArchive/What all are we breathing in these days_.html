But what do you really know about this invisible substance that is all around us? In this interesting guide, we look at some fascinating facts about the air we breathe and how air conditioning can benefit us more than we realise, in terms of both health and productivity.  The most important ‘ingredient’ in the air we breathe is, of course, oxygen. The vast majority of air consists of two components – 21% Oxygen and 78% Nitrogen. The remaining 1% is a mixture of other gasses which includes Carbon Dioxide, Argon and others. That said, it is believed that it is the high proportion of nitrogen that created the perfect conditions for life to be formed, making Earth the only known planet to support life. The composition of air changes when we inhale and exhale. The table below shows what happens to the composition of air when we breathe*: The most important ‘ingredient’ in the air we breathe is, of course, oxygen. The vast majority of air consists of two components – 21% Oxygen and 78% Nitrogen. The remaining 1% is a mixture of other gasses which includes Carbon Dioxide, Argon and others. That said, it is believed that it is the high proportion of nitrogen that created the perfect conditions for life to be formed, making Earth the only known planet to support life. The composition of air changes when we inhale and exhale. The table below shows what happens to the composition of air when we breathe:  As you can see, as air is inhaled and exhaled, there are significant changes in the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. If the levels are not restored through a constant supply of fresh air, we can experience drowsiness. Fact: Working as part of a fully maintained ventilation installation, an air conditioning system helps to ensure that the air maintains an optimum temperature. A constant cycle of air provided by a a fully operating HVAC system will further assist by restoring oxygen levels and therefore helping to eliminate tiredness and boost productivity in the workplace. It can also ensure that increased moisture levels in the air as a result of breathing are not able to gather and lead to other problems such as condensation and damp spots – provided of course that the HVAC system allows fresh air to enter and damp air to escape.  Whilst contaminants may only form a tiny proportion of the air around us in our homes, offices and workplaces, they can have a huge impact on our health both long and short term. So what are the worst offenders? Carbon Monoxide (CO) – interferes with the ability of blood to carry oxygen. In small amounts it can cause drowsiness and nausea, whilst high levels can cause unconsciousness or even death in the worst cases. The most common sources of carbon monoxide are cooking and heating devices within buildings, and vehicle fumes from traffic. One of the biggest risks of carbon monoxide is its tendency to accumulate in enclosed spaces – offices and workplaces included. Fact: An air-conditioning system can help to reduce the danger of carbon monoxide by helping to keep air moving and avoid accumulation (industrial premises and commercial kitchens, however, should also pay careful attention to their extraction systems – air conditioning forms just part of the HVAC system). Ozone (O3) – in severe cases, inhalation can lead to damage to lung tissue, retinal damage and cataracts. One of the biggest causes of ozone in the workplace is photocopiers. Care should always be taken to follow the manufacturer’s advice for safe operation. Did you know: Ozone is not only caused by equipment – it is also naturally produced as a result of atoms becoming energised by the heat of the sun. Particulate matter (PM) – affects lungs: tiny solid or liquid particles present in the outside air, especially in urban environments. Key sources include lorry and car engines, burning coal, fires and blowing dust. Fact: opening the office windows allows a free flow for all particulate matter into the office. An air conditioning installation, on the other hand, will filter out the vast majority of PM, meaning it is a considerably better solution for most workplaces. The cost of operation will be more than offset by the health benefits to staff. Random Fact: The air we breathe is contained within the Earth’s atmosphere. Did you know that if the world was an apple, the atmosphere that forms the layer of air we breathe would be as thin as its skin!  An increasing number of people are suffering from asthma, and with increased levels of pollution, the symptoms can be more and more pronounced. Air pollution and pollen are amongst the biggest triggers for asthma, and both can be substantially reduced by using a well maintained air conditioning system with the correct filters installed. Heatwaves are reported to be a major trigger for asthma attacks, therefore maintaining a comfortable working environment in the summer months can be highly beneficial to your staff. It is worth noting, however, that in a recent survey by Asthma UK* 75% of respondents indicated that cold air – including that caused by excessive air conditioning – can cause symptoms of asthma. It is important, therefore, to consider the balance between the benefits and risks before simply setting the air conditioning to max. Used correctly and considerately, an air conditioning system in the workplace can provide real-time health benefits to your team, boosting productivity and avoiding the costs associated with absence due to sickness. * https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/weather/  You might think that you are well travelled, but the chances are that the miles you’ve covered in your lifetime are nothing compared to the air you breathe. The air that surrounds our planet is never still, thanks to the effect of the sun’s heat. In fact, the transportation of elements and particles that is facilitated by this constant movement plays a vital role in the world’s ecosystem. Fact: what many people don’t realise is that the air around has travelled thousands of miles. In fact, what you are breathing right now may have been halfway around the world just a few days ago. In the course of its journey, air picks up all kinds of passengers – an increasing number of which are, unfortunately, harmful to the health. This makes it increasingly preferable to use air conditioning for its filtering function. So how did this air come into being? The vast majority of air within the atmosphere was actually formed billions of years ago by tectonic forces – the same forces that are responsible for creating volcanoes and mountains, as well as causing earthquakes and tsunamis. The other key factor in the creation of the air around us is photosynthesis – the process through which plants live, and in which carbon dioxide is extracted from the atmosphere to be replaced with oxygen. Fact: Plants and trees play a vital role in producing the oxygen in the air we breathe. Think about this next time you inadvertently forget to water the office foliage!  It is commonly believed that the number of people in a room can cause an increase in the temperature – but is this true or just an urban myth? Even an extensive search of the major search engines will fail to provide a scientifically supported answer to resolve this debate once and for all. It is suggested that the increase in heat would, theoretically, be at a minimum directly proportional to the number of people who enter a sealed room. It is often said that the temperature in an office could rise by one degree for every person present – but if you consider an office with thirty people, it is easy to see the flaw. Other factors would also come into play – the more activity people do, the greater the increase would theoretically be. The final word – Sorry, if you were thinking of going home to reduce the numbers and make everybody else that little bit cooler (a noble gesture, wouldn’t you agree?) that just isn’t going to cut it with the boss! Ultimately, the temperature of your office or workspace is most affected by the air temperature in and around the building, and the best working environment is most effectively controlled with a correctly installed and properly used air conditioning system. However, the number of people, amongst other factors, is a highly important factor – especially in premises such as nightclubs for example require more AC due to large amounts of people in small areas. Gyms require almost double that of an office due to the extra heat. Glass also has a huge impact on the ac kit – When working out an AC system people numbers, electrical equipment, lighting and glass are all taken into account; so it pays to have a specialist do the maths!  Maintaining a healthy temperature in the workplace during the warmer summer months has numerous benefits. According to Unison*, “Too much heat can make us feel tired and less energetic, cause heat (muscle) cramps, and place extra strain on the heart and lungs. Tiredness and loss of concentration can also lead to an increased risk of accidents.” Now that alone sounds like a good reason to make sure that your air conditioning is running smoothly. *https://www.unison.org.uk/content/uploads/2014/08/TowebTemperature-at-Work-Information-Sheet-Aug14-update2.pdf As it stands, the law does not define a specific maximum working temperature, however Unison is amongst parties calling for this to be changed. At present, an employer is legally required to provide a working environment which is “so far as is reasonably practicable, safe, without risks to health, and which has adequate welfare facilities” according to (s2(2)(e) of the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA). Whilst in reality this may only have a direct effect on certain kinds of workplaces where exposure to extreme temperatures forms part of the job, all employers should bear it in mind. As a general guideline for normal working conditions, an absolute maximum temperature for indoor work would be 30C; or 27C where the work is strenuous. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the maximum temperature for indoor working should ideally not exceed 24C. A minimum of 20C is also recommended for offices. Fact: The easiest and most cost effective way to maintain the working conditions suggested by the TUC, UNISON and WHO amongst others is to use an air conditioning system at the correct settings. With the chance of changes being made into law in the future, it makes sense to invest now if you haven’t already and stay ahead of the game.

Our key findings add to the evidence that a changing climate is making it harder to protect human health. Share your voice and advocate for policies that will save lives. Get involved today by raising funds and awareness in your community. Your lungs are an essential part of the respiratory system that work together to help you breathe. Learn how your lungs work and how to keep your lungs and yourself healthy. You can live for two weeks without food, two days without water, but only two minutes without air. Every single organ in your body is made up of cells, and they all require oxygen for you to live. Your lungs are part of the respiratory system, a group of organs and tissues that work together to help you breathe. The respiratory system’s main job is to transport oxygen and remove extra carbon dioxide. Let’s start by looking at the components of this important body system. The diaphragm is the main muscle for breathing. This dome-shaped wall of muscle does most of the breathing work by expanding and contracting the chest to draw air in and out of your lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, air is pulled into your airway through your nose or mouth. Air then travels down your airway, or trachea, dividing into your right or left lung via the bronchi. The bronchi then separate into small tubes called bronchioles. Like tree branches, bronchioles divide into thousands of even smaller passages. At the end of each bronchiole is a cluster of little air sacs called alveoli. Alveoli are wrapped in tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The air you breathe in fills these air sacs with oxygen-rich air. This is where the exchange of gases occurs. Carbon dioxide is the gas we naturally produce and need to remove when our bodies use oxygen for energy. At this point, the capillaries are packed with carbon dioxide, and the alveoli are full of oxygen. Oxygen and carbon dioxide pass through these capillaries into the air sacs. As oxygen crosses over into the capillaries, the red blood cells capture it, while the carbon dioxide is unloaded into the lungs to be removed. The oxygen-rich hemoglobin is transported throughout the body and the lungs exhale the carbon dioxide. This never-ending cycle keeps all parts of your body supplied with oxygen. Your lungs have developed a few defenses against constant exposure to particles in the air that you breathe in. Your bronchial tubes are lined with cilia - thin, little hairs - and coated with mucus… …to capture these unwelcome intruders and sweep the mucus-coated particles back up to your throat until you cough, sneeze, or swallow to get rid of them. All day, every day, your lungs repeat this critical job of keeping your body supplied with the oxygen you need. That's why we say, "When you can't breathe, nothing else matters." Learn more at Lung.org Watch in Spanish Every cell in your body needs oxygen to live. The air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases. The respiratory system's main job is to move fresh air into your body while removing waste gases. Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body. At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide.

Learn how your lungs work and how to keep your lungs and yourself healthy. You can live for two weeks without food, two days without water, but only two minutes without air. Every single organ in your body is made up of cells, and they all require oxygen for you to live. Your lungs are part of the respiratory system, a group of organs and tissues that work together to help you breathe. The respiratory system’s main job is to transport oxygen and remove extra carbon dioxide. Let’s start by looking at the components of this important body system. The diaphragm is the main muscle for breathing. This dome-shaped wall of muscle does most of the breathing work by expanding and contracting the chest to draw air in and out of your lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, air is pulled into your airway through your nose or mouth. Air then travels down your airway, or trachea, dividing into your right or left lung via the bronchi. The bronchi then separate into small tubes called bronchioles. Like tree branches, bronchioles divide into thousands of even smaller passages. At the end of each bronchiole is a cluster of little air sacs called alveoli. Alveoli are wrapped in tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The air you breathe in fills these air sacs with oxygen-rich air. This is where the exchange of gases occurs. Carbon dioxide is the gas we naturally produce and need to remove when our bodies use oxygen for energy. At this point, the capillaries are packed with carbon dioxide, and the alveoli are full of oxygen. Oxygen and carbon dioxide pass through these capillaries into the air sacs. As oxygen crosses over into the capillaries, the red blood cells capture it, while the carbon dioxide is unloaded into the lungs to be removed. The oxygen-rich hemoglobin is transported throughout the body and the lungs exhale the carbon dioxide. This never-ending cycle keeps all parts of your body supplied with oxygen. Your lungs have developed a few defenses against constant exposure to particles in the air that you breathe in. Your bronchial tubes are lined with cilia - thin, little hairs - and coated with mucus… …to capture these unwelcome intruders and sweep the mucus-coated particles back up to your throat until you cough, sneeze, or swallow to get rid of them. All day, every day, your lungs repeat this critical job of keeping your body supplied with the oxygen you need. That&#x27;s why we say, &quot;When you can&#x27;t breathe, nothing else matters.&quot; Learn more at Lung.org Watch in Spanish Every cell in your body needs oxygen to live. The air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases. The respiratory system&#x27;s main job is to move fresh air into your body while removing waste gases. Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body. At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide. Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the bloodstream and then exhaled. Your lungs and respiratory system automatically perform this vital process, called gas exchange. In addition to gas exchange, your respiratory system performs other roles important to breathing. These include: Lung capacity declines as you age. Keep your lungs healthy by taking good care of yourself every day. Eat a balanced diet, exercise and reduce stress to breathe easier.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Almost the entire global population (99%) breathes air that exceeds WHO air quality limits, and threatens their health. A record number of over 6000 cities in 117 countries are now monitoring air quality, but the people living in them are still
breathing unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, with people in low and middle-income countries suffering the highest exposures.  The findings have prompted the World Health Organization to highlight the importance of curbing fossil fuel use and taking other tangible steps to reduce air pollution levels. Released in the lead-up to World Health Day, which this year celebrates the theme Our planet, our health, the 2022 update of the World Health Organization’s air quality database introduces, for the first time, ground measurements of annual mean
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a common urban pollutant and precursor of particulate matter and ozone. It also includes measurements of particulate matter with diameters equal or smaller than 10 μm (PM10) or 2.5
μm (PM2.5).  Both groups of pollutants originate mainly from human activities related to fossil fuel combustion. The new air quality database is the most extensive yet in its coverage of air pollution exposure on the ground. Some 2,000 more cities/human settlements are now recording ground monitoring data for particulate matter – PM10 and/or PM2.5 –
than the last update. This marks an almost 6-fold rise in reporting since the database was launched in 2011. Meanwhile, the evidence base for the damage air pollution does to the human body has been growing rapidly and points to significant harm caused by even low levels of many air pollutants. Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, is capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and entering the bloodstream, causing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular (stroke) and respiratory impacts. There is emerging evidence that particulate matter impacts
other organs and causes other diseases as well.  NO2 is associated with respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing), hospital admissions and visits to emergency rooms  WHO last year revised its Air Quality Guidelines, making them more stringent in an effort to help countries better evaluate the healthiness of their own air.  “Current energy concerns highlight the importance of speeding up the transition to cleaner, healthier energy systems,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “High fossil fuel prices, energy security, and the urgency
of addressing the twin health challenges of air pollution and climate change, underscore the pressing need to move faster towards a world that is much less dependent on fossil fuels.”  A number of governments are taking steps to improve air quality, but WHO is calling for a rapid intensification of actions to: In the 117 countries monitoring air quality, the air in 17% of cities in high-income countries fall below the WHO’s Air Quality Guidelines for PM2.5 or PM10.  In low- and middle-income countries, air quality in less than 1% of the cities complies with WHO recommended thresholds. Globally, low- and middle-income countries still experience greater exposure to unhealthy levels of PM compared to the global average, but NO2 patterns are different, showing less difference between the high- and low- and middle-income
countries.  About 4000 cities/human settlements in 74 countries collect NO2 data at ground level. Aggregated, their measurements show that only 23% of people in these places breathe annual average concentrations of NO2 that meet levels in the
recently updated version of WHO’s Air Quality Guidelines.
 “After surviving a pandemic, it is unacceptable to still have 7 million preventable deaths and countless preventable lost years of good health due to air pollution. That’s what we’re saying when we look at the mountain of air pollution
data, evidence, and solutions available. Yet too many investments are still being sunk into a polluted environment rather than in clean, healthy air,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. People living in lower and middle-income countries are the most exposed to air pollution. They are also the least covered in terms of air quality measurement – but the situation is improving.  Europe, and to some extent North America, remain the regions with the most comprehensive data on air quality. In many low- and middle-income countries, while PM2.5 measurements are still not available, they have seen large improvements for
measurements between the last database update in 2018 and this one, with an additional 1500 human settlements in these countries monitoring air quality.  The evidence base for the harm caused by air pollution has been growing rapidly and points to significant harm caused by even low levels of many air pollutants. Last year, the WHO responded by revising its Air Quality Guidelines to reflect the evidence,
making them more stringent, especially for PM and NO2, a move strongly supported by the health community, medical associations and patient organizations. The 2022 database aims to monitor the state of the world’s air and feeds into progress tracking of the Sustainable Development Goals.  World Health Day, marked on 7 April, will focus global attention on urgent actions needed to keep humans and the planet healthy and foster a movement to create societies focused on well-being. WHO estimates that more than 13 million deaths around the
world each year are due to avoidable environmental causes.    ### Note for editors: The report and WHO air quality database 2022. The latest WHO Air Quality Guidelines (2021) recommend the following concentration limits for these pollutants: For PM2.5: Annual average 5 µg/m3; 24-hour average 15 µg/m3 For PM10: Annual average 15 µg/m3; 24-hour average 45 µg/m3 For NO2: Annual average 10 µg/m3; 24-hour average 25 µg/m3 Interim targets also exist to guide action to protect health in places where air pollution is very high.    Media Contacts  WHO Media Team

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Breathing is an involuntary mechanism that we repeat about 12 times every minute, for a total of 20,000 times a day! In just one day, we inhale more or less 11,500 litres of air, containing 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, and 1% argon. On exhaling, we expel a lot of water, up to 17.5 millilitres per hour at rest, and as much as 70 millilitres when exercising. During physical activity, a difference in breathing has also been noted between men and women. It seems that the smaller size of a woman’s airways increases the work of the muscles of the respiratory system, making breathing under effort more tiring. We can breathe either by mouth or nose, but experts recommend more the latter, as it allows the body to defend itself more easily from the possible entry of external agents. Indeed, the nose acts as a filter, preventing the largest pollutant particles from reaching the lungs. In addition to being filtered, air inhaled through the nose reaches the lungs warmer and more humid. The lungs then take care of transferring oxygen into the blood, cleaning it of carbon dioxide, and transmitting it to the heart, ready to be sent to all the tissues and organs of the body. What we have described so far, as we wrote at the beginning, is an unconscious mechanism, which, however, can be modulated for the benefit of our physical and mental health, through practices such as yoga and other habits. Slower, deeper breathing can even affect our appetite, reducing it, as well as significantly improving the quality of sleep. Deep breathing has also been shown to induce a long-lasting sensation of calm and relaxation. Indeed, it is easy to note, for example, how much our breathing can change if we are agitated, stressed, or if we are calm and relaxed. As anxiety increases, our breathing becomes shorter, while it lengthens as we become calmer. For such reasons, it is important to practice deep breathing, because, if we can do this, we can reduce the conditions of anxiety and stress we are subjected to on a daily basis. Breathing can also have a huge impact on our energy, as it is known that performing certain exercises during which we control our inhalation, exhalation and take short pauses to breathe, can contribute significantly to increasing energy and thus to facing the day with more energy. We realise how important it is to have vitality and energy precisely when we are lacking them. In addition to the correct breathing we have just talked about, there are various practices that contribute to our energy wellbeing, from proper nutrition to physical activity. If the latter is practised in the open air, it allows us to stay in touch with Natural Environmental Energy and to perceive the vibrational and luminous frequencies of nature. Today we can find all this at any time, even indoors, thanks to magma13, an intelligent technology capable of turning the environment in which we live into a natural source of energy.

What we have described so far, as we wrote at the beginning, is an unconscious mechanism, which, however, can be modulated for the benefit of our physical and mental health, through practices such as yoga and other habits. Slower, deeper breathing can even affect our appetite, reducing it, as well as significantly improving the quality of sleep. Deep breathing has also been shown to induce a long-lasting sensation of calm and relaxation. Indeed, it is easy to note, for example, how much our breathing can change if we are agitated, stressed, or if we are calm and relaxed. As anxiety increases, our breathing becomes shorter, while it lengthens as we become calmer. For such reasons, it is important to practice deep breathing, because, if we can do this, we can reduce the conditions of anxiety and stress we are subjected to on a daily basis. Breathing can also have a huge impact on our energy, as it is known that performing certain exercises during which we control our inhalation, exhalation and take short pauses to breathe, can contribute significantly to increasing energy and thus to facing the day with more energy. We realise how important it is to have vitality and energy precisely when we are lacking them. In addition to the correct breathing we have just talked about, there are various practices that contribute to our energy wellbeing, from proper nutrition to physical activity. If the latter is practised in the open air, it allows us to stay in touch with Natural Environmental Energy and to perceive the vibrational and luminous frequencies of nature. Today we can find all this at any time, even indoors, thanks to magma13, an intelligent technology capable of turning the environment in which we live into a natural source of energy.

                         Amid the sadness and loss brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, one silver lining of 2020 was supposed to be the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Clean Air Act. For many years, there was a great deal to celebrate as the law has been very successful in cleaning up our air.  Between 1970 when it was signed and 2017, the levels of six common pollutants (ozone, lead, pollutant particles, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide) dropped 73%. The past few years, however, have seen a striking reversal in our air quality, with no signs of improvement. The American Lung Association reported in its 2020 “State of the Air” report that 45.8% of Americans, or 150 million people, live in counties with either unhealthy levels of ozone or particle pollution. This number has risen steadily in every report since 2017, when the number was documented at 125 million people. Globally, the situation is even worse. The World Health Organization estimates that a staggering 91% of the world’s population live in places where air quality guidelines are not being met. This leads to the yearly premature death of 4.2 million people from outdoor air pollution and another 3.8 million from indoor air pollution. Most of these deaths are among the very old and very young.  The typical causes of toxic air deaths are respiratory infections, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer, but little known is that pollution is also a major contributor to ischemic heart disease and strokes. Newer data also connect poor air quality to neurodevelopmental disorders in children and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s in adults. All of this would be anathema to our ancestors, who understood the importance of the quality of our breathing, not just for health but for spiritual well-being. In the book of Job, the suffering man’s friend Elihu comments that “the Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.” This same concept is embodied in the New Testament, in which the apostle John says that Jesus “breathed on his disciples,” giving them the Holy Spirit. The sanctity of breath is not limited to the west. The principles of Buddhism and Hinduism are based on an understanding of the breath; indeed, the study of breathing, and the harnessing of its potential, is the only recognized way to nirvana. As the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh has written, “Breath is the bridge which connects life to consciousness, [and] unites your body to your mind.” The lungs are a miracle of design, packing some 480 million gas exchange units, or alveoli, into a small area. Arranged on end, the tubes of our lungs would stretch for fifteen hundred miles. Each day we take some 20,000 breaths, about 7.5 million breaths each year. This work is all done by an organ that resembles a sponge, with a thin lacy structure, the alveoli under constant stress from being in direct contact with the environment and all its pollutants, bacteria and viruses.  Problems with our breath have been building for several decades. Of the four leading causes of death between 2000 and 2018, mortality from chronic respiratory disease was the only one to increase. Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in America. Interstitial lung diseases like sarcoidosis increased 100% between 1980 and 2014. There are five million more people in the U.S. with asthma in 2017 compared to 2001.  More recently, things have taken several dramatic turns for the worse, from the vaping crisis that affected so many of our young people to the rampant wildfires throughout the globe, and, of course, the COVID-19 crisis, which has put thousands on ventilators and has so far killed over 500,000 Americans. We have not taken threats to our air seriously enough. It is likely that the wildfires have contributed the most to our worsening air quality over the past several years. It is also the case that, in the long term, they will be the hardest to contain. That’s because the underlying cause is climate change, an environmental and health crisis that needs broad support here and throughout the world to slow and even reverse. Environmental health crises can be overcome. Air pollution harms health and can be deadly, and more than 50 years ago, dense, visible smog in many cities and industrial centers were harming the health of Americans, and it prompted the passage of the 1970 legislation and major revisions made in the subsequent decades were designed to improve its effectiveness and target newly recognized air pollution problems such as acid rain. The Clean Air Act was designed to protect public health and welfare from different types of air pollution caused by a diverse array of sources, and passage of this landmark legislation has saved countless lives. While we enjoy healthier air thanks to the Clean Air Act, climate change poses new risks to our air quality. We know air pollution harms health and can be deadly, and new research suggests that exposure to particle pollution can even increase the death toll from COVID-19. The most recent “State of the Air” report from the American Lung Association is a warning, one that with signs of obviously declining lung health due to the pandemic we can no longer choose to ignore. The year 2020 was the year our breath was taken away, but with a concerted effort to support the science behind cleaning up our air, hopefully in the future we will look on it not as a year of crisis, but as a turning point to a healthier breath and planet. To initiate action today, I am committing to the upcoming American Lung Association 2021 Fight For Air Climb – Philadelphia to raise much needed funds for research (http://action.lung.org/goto/michaelstephen). Lung diseases have traditionally been underfunded. An example is lung cancer, which causes 22 percent of cancer deaths each year but receives only 6 percent of federal dollars for cancer research. The right to healthy breath is a universal right, and with everybody’s effort we can get the clean air we all need and deserve.   Michael J. Stephen M.D. is an Associate Professor of Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and head of the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center. He is the author of the recent book Breath Taking, which is an in depth analysis of the power, fragility, and future of the lungs.
