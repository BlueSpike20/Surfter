                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: And one bonus prize. So you’ve gone and destroyed the planet you called home. It was inevitable. Climate change reached the tipping point. Famine and disease ravaged humanity. A noxious information ecosystem sent society into a conspiracy-fuelled death cycle. To survive, we gotta get out of Dodge. To crib from Blade Runner, a new life awaits on off-world colonies. Maybe your fresh start is in Elon Musk’s Mars city. Maybe it is on the Moon with NASA’s lunar base. Or maybe a Zefram Cochrane-like figure has invented faster-than-light travel. Or, well, near-light speed travel if we are really patient. Who needs the Solar System if we don’t have Earth, am I right? You’ve got one ticket off Earth. Where do you go? There are a few possible planets we can go to and some are definitely better than others. There’s surviving — where we can make it work with a lot of sacrifices, but it won’t be easy — and then there’s thriving: finding a truly new home for humanity instead of a stopgap.  Here’s a guide to going off-world. At the end of the day, it will make you appreciate Earth.  Welcome to FUTURE EARTH, where Inverse forecasts 100 years of possibilities, challenges, and who will lead the way. Welcome to Venus. We know, we know. Venus. Some might say it is toxic, hot, and inhospitable. And they are right. But Mars is deadly too, albeit in the opposite direction. Just as Venus is extremely hot, Mars is frigid cold. Venus has a thick, poisonous atmosphere, but Mars has a paper-thin one. Mars has all that radiation exposure to boot, which doesn’t sound that nice. For Empire Strikes Back fans irresistibly drawn to the idea of living in a Cloud City, NASA has a plan. Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud car not included. Meet HAVOC — or the High Altitude Venus Operational Concept. HAVOC is basically a blimp and a fleet of other buoyant vehicles designed to explore Venus with humans on board. The truly inhospitable region of Venus lies far below, near, and at the surface. About 30 miles above the surface, temperatures are actually Earth-like. At this altitude, atmospheric pressure is also similar to Earth at sea level. There’s also similar radiation protection at that level. The air isn’t breathable, but the other factors mean spacesuits for venturing outside — like on an observation deck — wouldn’t be overly bulky affairs. HAVOC is still on the drawing board, but the preliminary design calls for a craft that would allow two astronauts to live on Venus for 30 days. Or above it, at least. The paper introducing HAVOC as a concept reveals ambitions for the world. HAVOC phase I is to send robots to Venus’ clouds. Phases II through IV are composed of increasingly ambitious human missions of increasingly long stays. The goal for Phase V? Permanent human habitation of a Venus cloud city. “Ultimately, the authors conclude that Venus, with its relatively hospitable upper atmosphere, can play a role in humanity’s future in space,” the authors write in the paper. Who are we to argue? The Inverse analysis: Steampunk fans may love living on an airship, and Earth-like pressure at high altitudes could make for less clunky spacesuits. But one small failure could spell major doom for would-be Venusians.  Habitable rating: 🎈☣️ ☣️ ☣️ Welcome to Mars.  “There are three reasons underlying the case for Mars,” Robert Zubrin tells Inverse. “For the science, for the challenge, and for the future.” Zubrin should know — he is the founder of the Mars Society, which advocates for moving humans to Mars as soon as possible. To understand Zubrin’s passion for the Red Planet, let’s break those three elements down — the science, the challenge, and the future. The science refers to the question we could soon answer: if there was life on Mars. If there is life on Mars, even. The challenge is a throwback to the space race that led to Apollo, and a sort of knock-on effect that draws more dreamers to the sciences. The future is the idea of humanity staking a permanent future off-Earth. Zubrin says has all the resources we need, if we can harness them correctly: Humanity’s transition to Mars is inevitable, as far as Zubrin is concerned. It will happen in four phases, he says: exploration is the first step before we set up a Mars base, which we can springboard into cities somewhere in between Musk and Total Recall, and from there, entire societies can flourish. Zubrin doesn’t see human movement on Mars as monolithic. Like Earth, different groups will settle in, and pursue different values and goals. The planet will bring them new opportunities to practice the forms of governance and beliefs they wish they could on Earth, he says. Ultimately, Mars offers a chance for renewal and a clean slate. And it is a mere six-month flight away. Deliverance has never been so handy. The resources of Mars could also be a launching pad for further exploration, Zubrin says. Methane and water on the planet can be used to create rocket fuel. After Mars, the next jump is the asteroid belt. And after that? “The goal is the stars,” Zubrin says. “As humans become spacefarers, we’re going to learn a lot more about the stars, about the planets orbiting the stars.” What if there’s already life on Mars, and it is still alive? Zubrin says that most of the arguments for current life on Mars are easily refuted, so humanity can rest easy there. One of the biggest criticisms of potential human settlements on Mars is the idea of cross-contamination: Either that humans will incidentally kill off whatever life there is on the Red Planet, or conversely, that that life could threaten us instead. But one way we know about the conditions on Mars is because chunks of it frequently fall to Earth, products of impacts ejected across interplanetary distances. “The issue of back contamination which is the one that gets the biggest headlines is nonsense,” Zubrin says. “We’ve been getting materials from Earth every year for four billion years.” Carl Sagan once said, "If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if they are only microbes." But Zubrin calls this an “aesthetic issue.” He says, for instance, that on Earth, we happily murder microbes all day, every day — mouthwash, antibiotics, household cleaners — our poisons are as varied as they are effective. And yet, we don’t regard these acts of destruction on our own planet as an ethical issue. “I think that Sagan got carried away in a poetic fit when he made that statement,” Zubrin says. “The idea that an entire planet — the whole potential of a new biosphere of not only people but of an entire assortment of wonderful plants and animals that could grow in flourish on Mars — should be abluted because there are microbes on Mars is absurd and I would say unethical to say that people should not exist on Mars so that it can be safe for microbes.” The Inverse analysis: Despite sub-Antarctic temperatures, space radiation, and other hazards at least there’s terra firma (martis ferma?) to stand on and a gateway to the rest of the Solar System and points beyond. Just hope nothing goes wrong. Habitable rating: 🚀👩‍🚀👩‍🚀 Welcome to Proxima Centauri b. When it comes to planets in the solar system to use as humanity’s ark, the pickings are slim. We’ve got Mars. We’ve (sort of) got Venus. Beyond that, the only terrestrial planet left — Mercury — is too hot on one side and absolutely frigid on the other. It’s also notoriously hard to get to thanks to the gravity of the Sun. Jupiter’s out — we would fry in a bath of radiation. The other gas planets aren’t hospitable either. So maybe we just build a generation ship or pray for a warp drive and punt ourselves a star system over. And where better to aim than Proxima Centauri? Abel Mendez is the director of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) at the University of Puerto Rico Arecibo. Mendez has maintained the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog for 10 years. At the time the catalog began, the number of potentially habitable exoplanets was scant: Back then, it was made up of just Gliese 667 C f, and the contentious and ever-evolving planets in the Gliese 581 system. (Gliese, in this case, refers to a star catalog — while the stars are 20 and 23 light-years away from Earth, respectively, they’re not close to each other.) Since then, the number has beefed up to 60 potentially habitable worlds if we’re lucky, or 24 if we’re being realistic. Mendez uses a rubric to rate these worlds using a few factors: Of the 4,375 known exoplanets (as of April 16, 2021, according to NASA), this rubric means only 24 of them are potentially habitable. But the right size and distance are only two of the things we need for habitability in reality. Beyond these traits, we don’t have much other information to go on. This is why Mendez says if we had to go somewhere beyond the Solar System, we should go somewhere close. “Otherwise we cannot tell, but assuming that information there is right … I think the planets I would prefer to visit are the nearby ones,” he says. And there’s no habitable planet closer than Proxima Centauri b. Alpha Centauri A and B are pretty well known. They’re the closest stars the size of the Sun to Earth. But they aren’t quite the closest star. The two stars orbit each other. But about .12 light-years out — around 7600 times the distance of the Sun to Earth — they have a faint companion. Alpha Centauri A and B have been known since antiquity and known to be two separate stars since 1689. Their companion, Proxima Centauri, is so small and faint that it wasn’t discovered until 1915. And while the Alphas Centauri are 4.37 light-years from Earth, that smidge of difference in distance puts Proxima Centauri just a fraction closer to Earth. We’ve looked time and time again for planets around one of the Alphas Centauri, usually coming up short. But in 2016, astronomers working as part of the Pale Red Dot project used decades of data on Proxima Centauri to draw out the existence of a possible planet, Proxima Centauri b. This planet is likely around the mass of Earth, and orbits in a tight 11-day loop around its star. While such a close orbit sounds like a recipe for disaster — Mercury, after all, orbits the Sun in 88 days — the small size and mass of Proxima Centauri and its lower temperatures mean that the planet could be habitable, under the right conditions. The star Proxima Centauri is only 20 percent larger than Jupiter and is just 12 percent the mass of the Sun. It’s classified as a red dwarf, also called an M-dwarf star. These stars are the least massive and most common types of stars in the universe. Not surprisingly, many of the planets on PHL’s index are M-dwarf stars. Only three are not. But — and there’s always a but — that doesn’t mean Proxima Centauri b is much like Earth. With that close an orbit, the planet faces the same side of the star at all times, the same way we only see one face of the Moon. This process is called tidal locking, and it is part of why Mercury is so inhospitable. “I think that most of these planets are probably tidally locked because there are around M-dwarf stars, and even if they have an atmosphere, water will be locked as ice on the dark side, and the dayside will be a desert,” Mendez says. But in between the two sides is a little sliver of liminal space that’s neither day nor night — a place of perpetual twilight. That’s where liquid water might exist, and life might flourish. There’s also the problem of atmospheres. Red dwarfs are small stars, but early in their history, they thrash around violently with flares — which can blow away the primordial atmospheres of planets out into the cosmos. So we have to hope that Proxima Centauri b was able to regrow an atmosphere and that it’s something like Earth, and not, say, Venus or Mars. The Inverse analysis: It’s close and in the right place to have life, but a lack of known details and a potentially hazardous star mean we shouldn’t go quite yet. Habitable rating: ❓❓🤷🤷🤷 Welcome to TRAPPIST-1d In 2015, Belgian astronomers working on the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) project announced a new star, dubbed (entirely by coincidence and not for promotion reasons, we are sure) TRAPPIST-1.  It’s small — about the size of Jupiter — and less massive even than Proxima Centauri. In fact, at 8.9 percent the mass of the Sun, it’s barely over the threshold of having enough mass to ignite. TRAPPIST-1 wasn’t alone — the astronomers announced three Earth-sized planets in orbit. And all three are potentially habitable. It was big news at the time. Three worlds a sneeze of a distance apart, all temperate enough to hold water, all around a fairly calm, tiny star. But subsequent studies pulled a real “hold my beer” and hit us with four more planets in orbit around TRAPPIST-1. All of them were close enough to be temperate too. Tiny but mighty, indeed. Suddenly, we have a very tantalizing system on our hands. The PHL index lists TRAPPIST-1d as the likeliest of all of them to have Earth-like conditions. But it’s not a one-one comparison. The planet is thought to be somewhere in between Mars and Earth in size. It’s got an Earth-like amount of radiation from its star and thus, likely, similar temperatures, too. So let’s go there! Or not. It might be just a little too hot, according to a 2018 study. "We are modeling unfamiliar atmospheres, not just assuming that the things we see in the solar system will look the same way around another star," a statement from the authors reads. In short, they say TRAPPIST-1d may be more Venus-like than we might like for habitability. They also argue: They conclude that TRAPPIST-1e may be the real world we should look to. The answer isn’t definitive though. And we likely won’t know anything until we can get a close look at the system via next-generation telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope. But if we go to TRAPPIST-1 and any one planet isn’t quite right, we could just jump to the next one — most of them are less than a million miles apart. If we don’t like TRAPPIST-1d, then TRAPPIST-1e is a mere 650,000-mile journey. Earth is 238,000 miles from the Moon. It took three days for Apollo astronauts to get to the Moon. It’s not the six-month trip to Mars humans would experience — it’d be more like an extended business trip. “You have seven planets, some in the habitable zone,” Mendez says. “You have in one system everything possible, and multiple planets with those conditions, hot or cold.” The term Goldilocks Zone is sometimes used in place of the habitable zone. Not too hot, not too cold, just right. But TRAPPIST-1 plays with that by making for a Goldilocks system where, in a few days, we can make our way in between the planets. Even the farthest out of the planets is only 1,400,000 miles from its home star. “If one planet doesn’t work, you just move to another planet,” Mendez says. And what’s more, it’s only 40 light-years away. Sure, that’s 10 times the distance of Earth to Proxima Centauri. And sure, even going half the speed of light makes for an 80-year one-way trip. But can you really put a price on the future of humanity? The Inverse analysis: Don’t like one planet? Hop to another. Heck, if they’re all habitable, choose your own adventure. If none are … good luck. Habitability rating: 🔥❄️😎🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱 But … what if red dwarfs don’t have the right stuff?  Aside from pillaging the PHL list of worlds, you eliminate the potential for robust life in the universe. You have to stick to stars like the Sun. And suddenly, we don’t have a lot of places nearby to go. Two of the remaining planets around non-M-dwarf stars on the PHL index aren’t an easy shot. Kepler-442 b is nearly 1200 light-years away. Kepler-62f is 980+ light-years away. We can’t get there. Welcome to Tau Ceti f.  Tau Ceti f is a hefty world. We haven’t seen it directly, but it’s at a minimum four times the mass of Earth. Gravity there would be high — not a lot of fun for those who like calisthenics. It’s also likely 1.8 times the radius of Earth (though we haven’t seen it pass in front of its star, so that’s a rough estimate). It has a 642-day orbit — one of the longest period known habitable exoplanets. But it has a lot of things in its favor. Tau Ceti is a Sun-like star, about 78 percent the mass of the Sun, and burns at similar temperatures. (Both are classified as G-stars.) At 12 light-years away, we could get there in 24 years going half the speed of light — just in time for babies leaving Earth to have a quarter-life crisis on arrival. Its Sun-like qualities have made it a popular destination for science fiction, including Dan Simmon’s Hyperion and Arthur C. Clarke’s Rama series. The star system also makes an appearance in Star Trek, Barbarella, Doctor Who, The Expanse, and … uh … Earth: Final Conflict. It’s the nerd connoisseur's Sun-like star, to all you Alpha Centauri-loving plebes.  It’s not exactly high on the list of the 24 most habitable planets on the list. In fact, it’s 22 on a list of 24. It’s not graduating with honors. It’s only listed as having a .58 Earth Similarity Index (.99 is the highest possible, and Proxima Centauri b has .87 and TRAPPIST-1d .90, sitting at #4 and #6, respectively.) So maybe Tau Ceti f isn’t quite what we want there, either — especially with the gravity and potential to be more of a small Neptune than a large Earth. There could be moons. We might find an elusive candidate, Tau Ceti PxP-4, that (if it exists) is in the habitable zone too. In other words, it’s still worth the trip — especially if the red dwarf stars are out. The Inverse analysis: Earth-like temperatures could make this a great place to go, and if the planet isn’t so great, maybe it has an ok moon … or even another planet waiting for us. Habitability rating: 🤔🤔🤔 Welcome to Callisto. Okay, okay. We know. Not a planet — it’s Jupiter's outermost large moon. But hear us out. Let’s say astronomers realize Proxima Centauri b isn’t habitable. Fine. There are other potentially habitable planets within the same distance as Tau Ceti, including Teegarden’s Star b (the most potentially habitable planet by PHL standards), Ross 128b, and Luyten’s Star, which we’ve already beamed a message to. We could just go there, but being that they’re all M-dwarf planets, the journey seems iffier. But let’s say Proxima Centauri b is very habitable. So habitable, in fact, that it’s rife with intelligent life. We aren’t going to be welcomed with open arms. We would, after all, be invaders — the kinds of aliens sci-fi has taught us to fear. (If you want to know how first contact can go very wrong, get out of hand if you will, read The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell.) Then we can’t go there either.  And if Mars and Venus are non-starters, there are still places we can go. They’re just not planets. They’re the water worlds of our Solar System, places like Ceres in the asteroid belt, Europa and Ganymede circling Jupiter, and Enceladus spewing oceanic water out into space. Even Titan looks like a cold version of early Earth — lakes of ethane and methane dotting the surface while an entire ocean of water is trapped deep below. Pluto might have a subsurface ocean. But we might not want to go down this path. Jupiter, for example, has some of the most deadly radiation in our solar system. When the Pioneer 10 probe passed it in 1974, NASA hadn’t correctly predicted just how much radiation it would emit. Even passing what they thought was a “safe” point, the probe was damaged by the radiation. And while Europa and Ganymede are watery ocean worlds underneath an icy crust, they’re within those radiation belts. The ice may protect life below but would endanger or flat-out fry humans above. There has to be a better way. And maybe there is. In 2003, NASA Langley researchers suggested a solution to the Ganymede / Europa problem. Just go a world over, to Callisto. Why is Callisto so promising?: It’s also made of water ice. This water could be used for drinking after some processing, sure, but it could also be refined into hydroxyzine for rocket fuel. What’s so tantalizing about Callisto (in the more immediate) is the chance it could be home base while we send robots off to Europa to explore. We could set up shop on the relatively safe far side of the moon and wait for the data to come back. Maybe it’s our new home, maybe it’s our new research station. Ultimately, the worlds beyond Earth seem pretty inhospitable. While humans are tough, you’re asking all of humanity to participate in the Shackleton Expedition. Or maybe we should just stay home and stay put, fixing our problems on Earth instead of running away to another planet. (But if we don’t, dibs on a condo on Tau Ceti f.)

To understand Zubrin’s passion for the Red Planet, let’s break those three elements down — the science, the challenge, and the future. The science refers to the question we could soon answer: if there was life on Mars. If there is life on Mars, even. The challenge is a throwback to the space race that led to Apollo, and a sort of knock-on effect that draws more dreamers to the sciences. The future is the idea of humanity staking a permanent future off-Earth. Zubrin says has all the resources we need, if we can harness them correctly: Humanity’s transition to Mars is inevitable, as far as Zubrin is concerned. It will happen in four phases, he says: exploration is the first step before we set up a Mars base, which we can springboard into cities somewhere in between Musk and Total Recall, and from there, entire societies can flourish. Zubrin doesn’t see human movement on Mars as monolithic. Like Earth, different groups will settle in, and pursue different values and goals. The planet will bring them new opportunities to practice the forms of governance and beliefs they wish they could on Earth, he says. Ultimately, Mars offers a chance for renewal and a clean slate. And it is a mere six-month flight away. Deliverance has never been so handy. The resources of Mars could also be a launching pad for further exploration, Zubrin says. Methane and water on the planet can be used to create rocket fuel. After Mars, the next jump is the asteroid belt. And after that? “The goal is the stars,” Zubrin says. “As humans become spacefarers, we’re going to learn a lot more about the stars, about the planets orbiting the stars.” What if there’s already life on Mars, and it is still alive? Zubrin says that most of the arguments for current life on Mars are easily refuted, so humanity can rest easy there. One of the biggest criticisms of potential human settlements on Mars is the idea of cross-contamination: Either that humans will incidentally kill off whatever life there is on the Red Planet, or conversely, that that life could threaten us instead. But one way we know about the conditions on Mars is because chunks of it frequently fall to Earth, products of impacts ejected across interplanetary distances. “The issue of back contamination which is the one that gets the biggest headlines is nonsense,” Zubrin says. “We’ve been getting materials from Earth every year for four billion years.” Carl Sagan once said, &quot;If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if they are only microbes.&quot; But Zubrin calls this an “aesthetic issue.” He says, for instance, that on Earth, we happily murder microbes all day, every day — mouthwash, antibiotics, household cleaners — our poisons are as varied as they are effective. And yet, we don’t regard these acts of destruction on our own planet as an ethical issue. “I think that Sagan got carried away in a poetic fit when he made that statement,” Zubrin says. “The idea that an entire planet — the whole potential of a new biosphere of not only people but of an entire assortment of wonderful plants and animals that could grow in flourish on Mars — should be abluted because there are microbes on Mars is absurd and I would say unethical to say that people should not exist on Mars so that it can be safe for microbes.” The Inverse analysis: Despite sub-Antarctic temperatures, space radiation, and other hazards at least there’s terra firma (martis ferma?) to stand on and a gateway to the rest of the Solar System and points beyond. Just hope nothing goes wrong. Habitable rating: 🚀👩‍🚀👩‍🚀 Welcome to Proxima Centauri b. When it comes to planets in the solar system to use as humanity’s ark, the pickings are slim. We’ve got Mars. We’ve (sort of) got Venus. Beyond that, the only terrestrial planet left — Mercury — is too hot on one side and absolutely frigid on the other. It’s also notoriously hard to get to thanks to the gravity of the Sun. Jupiter’s out — we would fry in a bath of radiation. The other gas planets aren’t hospitable either. So maybe we just build a generation ship or pray for a warp drive and punt ourselves a star system over. And where better to aim than Proxima Centauri? Abel Mendez is the director of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) at the University of Puerto Rico Arecibo. Mendez has maintained the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog for 10 years. At the time the catalog began, the number of potentially habitable exoplanets was scant: Back then, it was made up of just Gliese 667 C f, and the contentious and ever-evolving planets in the Gliese 581 system. (Gliese, in this case, refers to a star catalog — while the stars are 20 and 23 light-years away from Earth, respectively, they’re not close to each other.) Since then, the number has beefed up to 60 potentially habitable worlds if we’re lucky, or 24 if we’re being realistic. Mendez uses a rubric to rate these worlds using a few factors: Of the 4,375 known exoplanets (as of April 16, 2021, according to NASA), this rubric means only 24 of them are potentially habitable. But the right size and distance are only two of the things we need for habitability in reality. Beyond these traits, we don’t have much other information to go on. This is why Mendez says if we had to go somewhere beyond the Solar System, we should go somewhere close. “Otherwise we cannot tell, but assuming that information there is right … I think the planets I would prefer to visit are the nearby ones,” he says. And there’s no habitable planet closer than Proxima Centauri b. Alpha Centauri A and B are pretty well known. They’re the closest stars the size of the Sun to Earth. But they aren’t quite the closest star. The two stars orbit each other. But about .12 light-years out — around 7600 times the distance of the Sun to Earth — they have a faint companion. Alpha Centauri A and B have been known since antiquity and known to be two separate stars since 1689. Their companion, Proxima Centauri, is so small and faint that it wasn’t discovered until 1915. And while the Alphas Centauri are 4.37 light-years from Earth, that smidge of difference in distance puts Proxima Centauri just a fraction closer to Earth. We’ve looked time and time again for planets around one of the Alphas Centauri, usually coming up short. But in 2016, astronomers working as part of the Pale Red Dot project used decades of data on Proxima Centauri to draw out the existence of a possible planet, Proxima Centauri b. This planet is likely around the mass of Earth, and orbits in a tight 11-day loop around its star. While such a close orbit sounds like a recipe for disaster — Mercury, after all, orbits the Sun in 88 days — the small size and mass of Proxima Centauri and its lower temperatures mean that the planet could be habitable, under the right conditions. The star Proxima Centauri is only 20 percent larger than Jupiter and is just 12 percent the mass of the Sun. It’s classified as a red dwarf, also called an M-dwarf star. These stars are the least massive and most common types of stars in the universe. Not surprisingly, many of the planets on PHL’s index are M-dwarf stars. Only three are not. But — and there’s always a but — that doesn’t mean Proxima Centauri b is much like Earth. With that close an orbit, the planet faces the same side of the star at all times, the same way we only see one face of the Moon. This process is called tidal locking, and it is part of why Mercury is so inhospitable. “I think that most of these planets are probably tidally locked because there are around M-dwarf stars, and even if they have an atmosphere, water will be locked as ice on the dark side, and the dayside will be a desert,” Mendez says. But in between the two sides is a little sliver of liminal space that’s neither day nor night — a place of perpetual twilight. That’s where liquid water might exist, and life might flourish. There’s also the problem of atmospheres. Red dwarfs are small stars, but early in their history, they thrash around violently with flares — which can blow away the primordial atmospheres of planets out into the cosmos. So we have to hope that Proxima Centauri b was able to regrow an atmosphere and that it’s something like Earth, and not, say, Venus or Mars. The Inverse analysis: It’s close and in the right place to have life, but a lack of known details and a potentially hazardous star mean we shouldn’t go quite yet. Habitable rating: ❓❓🤷🤷🤷 Welcome to TRAPPIST-1d In 2015, Belgian astronomers working on the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) project announced a new star, dubbed (entirely by coincidence and not for promotion reasons, we are sure) TRAPPIST-1.  It’s small — about the size of Jupiter — and less massive even than Proxima Centauri. In fact, at 8.9 percent the mass of the Sun, it’s barely over the threshold of having enough mass to ignite. TRAPPIST-1 wasn’t alone — the astronomers announced three Earth-sized planets in orbit. And all three are potentially habitable. It was big news at the time. Three worlds a sneeze of a distance apart, all temperate enough to hold water, all around a fairly calm, tiny star. But subsequent studies pulled a real “hold my beer” and hit us with four more planets in orbit around TRAPPIST-1. All of them were close enough to be temperate too. Tiny but mighty, indeed. Suddenly, we have a very tantalizing system on our hands. The PHL index lists TRAPPIST-1d as the likeliest of all of them to have Earth-like conditions. But it’s not a one-one comparison. The planet is thought to be somewhere in between Mars and Earth in size. It’s got an Earth-like amount of radiation from its star and thus, likely, similar temperatures, too. So let’s go there! Or not. It might be just a little too hot, according to a 2018 study. &quot;We are modeling unfamiliar atmospheres, not just assuming that the things we see in the solar system will look the same way around another star,&quot; a statement from the authors reads. In short, they say TRAPPIST-1d may be more Venus-like than we might like for habitability. They also argue: They conclude that TRAPPIST-1e may be the real world we should look to. The answer isn’t definitive though. And we likely won’t know anything until we can get a close look at the system via next-generation telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope. But if we go to TRAPPIST-1 and any one planet isn’t quite right, we could just jump to the next one — most of them are less than a million miles apart. If we don’t like TRAPPIST-1d, then TRAPPIST-1e is a mere 650,000-mile journey. Earth is 238,000 miles from the Moon. It took three days for Apollo astronauts to get to the Moon. It’s not the six-month trip to Mars humans would experience — it’d be more like an extended business trip. “You have seven planets, some in the habitable zone,” Mendez says. “You have in one system everything possible, and multiple planets with those conditions, hot or cold.” The term Goldilocks Zone is sometimes used in place of the habitable zone. Not too hot, not too cold, just right. But TRAPPIST-1 plays with that by making for a Goldilocks system where, in a few days, we can make our way in between the planets. Even the farthest out of the planets is only 1,400,000 miles from its home star. “If one planet doesn’t work, you just move to another planet,” Mendez says. And what’s more, it’s only 40 light-years away. Sure, that’s 10 times the distance of Earth to Proxima Centauri. And sure, even going half the speed of light makes for an 80-year one-way trip. But can you really put a price on the future of humanity? The Inverse analysis: Don’t like one planet? Hop to another. Heck, if they’re all habitable, choose your own adventure. If none are … good luck. Habitability rating: 🔥❄️😎🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱 But … what if red dwarfs don’t have the right stuff?  Aside from pillaging the PHL list of worlds, you eliminate the potential for robust life in the universe. You have to stick to stars like the Sun. And suddenly, we don’t have a lot of places nearby to go. Two of the remaining planets around non-M-dwarf stars on the PHL index aren’t an easy shot. Kepler-442 b is nearly 1200 light-years away. Kepler-62f is 980+ light-years away. We can’t get there. Welcome to Tau Ceti f.  Tau Ceti f is a hefty world. We haven’t seen it directly, but it’s at a minimum four times the mass of Earth. Gravity there would be high — not a lot of fun for those who like calisthenics. It’s also likely 1.8 times the radius of Earth (though we haven’t seen it pass in front of its star, so that’s a rough estimate). It has a 642-day orbit — one of the longest period known habitable exoplanets. But it has a lot of things in its favor. Tau Ceti is a Sun-like star, about 78 percent the mass of the Sun, and burns at similar temperatures. (Both are classified as G-stars.) At 12 light-years away, we could get there in 24 years going half the speed of light — just in time for babies leaving Earth to have a quarter-life crisis on arrival. Its Sun-like qualities have made it a popular destination for science fiction, including Dan Simmon’s Hyperion and Arthur C. Clarke’s Rama series. The star system also makes an appearance in Star Trek, Barbarella, Doctor Who, The Expanse, and … uh … Earth: Final Conflict. It’s the nerd connoisseur&#x27;s Sun-like star, to all you Alpha Centauri-loving plebes.  It’s not exactly high on the list of the 24 most habitable planets on the list. In fact, it’s 22 on a list of 24. It’s not graduating with honors. It’s only listed as having a .58 Earth Similarity Index (.99 is the highest possible, and Proxima Centauri b has .87 and TRAPPIST-1d .90, sitting at #4 and #6, respectively.) So maybe Tau Ceti f isn’t quite what we want there, either — especially with the gravity and potential to be more of a small Neptune than a large Earth. There could be moons. We might find an elusive candidate, Tau Ceti PxP-4, that (if it exists) is in the habitable zone too. In other words, it’s still worth the trip — especially if the red dwarf stars are out. The Inverse analysis: Earth-like temperatures could make this a great place to go, and if the planet isn’t so great, maybe it has an ok moon … or even another planet waiting for us. Habitability rating: 🤔🤔🤔 Welcome to Callisto. Okay, okay. We know. Not a planet — it’s Jupiter&#x27;s outermost large moon. But hear us out. Let’s say astronomers realize Proxima Centauri b isn’t habitable. Fine. There are other potentially habitable planets within the same distance as Tau Ceti, including Teegarden’s Star b (the most potentially habitable planet by PHL standards), Ross 128b, and Luyten’s Star, which we’ve already beamed a message to. We could just go there, but being that they’re all M-dwarf planets, the journey seems iffier. But let’s say Proxima Centauri b is very habitable. So habitable, in fact, that it’s rife with intelligent life. We aren’t going to be welcomed with open arms. We would, after all, be invaders — the kinds of aliens sci-fi has taught us to fear. (If you want to know how first contact can go very wrong, get out of hand if you will, read The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell.) Then we can’t go there either.  And if Mars and Venus are non-starters, there are still places we can go. They’re just not planets. They’re the water worlds of our Solar System, places like Ceres in the asteroid belt, Europa and Ganymede circling Jupiter, and Enceladus spewing oceanic water out into space. Even Titan looks like a cold version of early Earth — lakes of ethane and methane dotting the surface while an entire ocean of water is trapped deep below. Pluto might have a subsurface ocean. But we might not want to go down this path. Jupiter, for example, has some of the most deadly radiation in our solar system. When the Pioneer 10 probe passed it in 1974, NASA hadn’t correctly predicted just how much radiation it would emit. Even passing what they thought was a “safe” point, the probe was damaged by the radiation. And while Europa and Ganymede are watery ocean worlds underneath an icy crust, they’re within those radiation belts. The ice may protect life below but would endanger or flat-out fry humans above. There has to be a better way. And maybe there is. In 2003, NASA Langley researchers suggested a solution to the Ganymede / Europa problem. Just go a world over, to Callisto. Why is Callisto so promising?: It’s also made of water ice. This water could be used for drinking after some processing, sure, but it could also be refined into hydroxyzine for rocket fuel. What’s so tantalizing about Callisto (in the more immediate) is the chance it could be home base while we send robots off to Europa to explore. We could set up shop on the relatively safe far side of the moon and wait for the data to come back. Maybe it’s our new home, maybe it’s our new research station. Ultimately, the worlds beyond Earth seem pretty inhospitable. While humans are tough, you’re asking all of humanity to participate in the Shackleton Expedition. Or maybe we should just stay home and stay put, fixing our problems on Earth instead of running away to another planet. (But if we don’t, dibs on a condo on Tau Ceti f.)

ESA’s BepiColombo craft is set to launch a year from now in October 2018 and head toward our innermost planet. Plenty of mysteries surround tiny Mercury, not the least of which is it seems to composed mostly of materials found in the cores of other planets. This means Mercury may have been the victim of a planetary pileup in which several planets collided and only Mercury made it out alive, leaving just a shell of its former self behind. If true, this may mean that Mercury was once the queen of the terrestrial planets — no small feat.  
 
4. Psyche
A protoplanet core may be hiding in plain sight in the asteroid belt. The Psyche orbiter is here to find out for sure. Named after its intended target, the craft will launch in 2022 for a 2026 encounter with the metal-rich asteroid Psyche. This world could be the key to unlocking how our solar system formed, and is one of the most unique objects in the solar system.  
 
Where to next?
In addition to these planned missions, there are plenty of missions to other solar system destinations we’d like to see in the future:  1. Uranus
Yes, yes, I know. We should send a probe to Uranus to study its dirty rings and understand how it got so sideways. But jokes aside, the seventh planet holds a lot of secrets waiting to be uncovered. It has moons with 12-mile-high cliffs, a little-understood ring system, an on-and-off magnetic field, and aurora activity like we’ve never seen.  You could say we have a lot to learn about Uranus.  2. Neptune
Neptune and Uranus are two very different worlds — both from each other and from the two gas giants in our solar system. Neptune has violent raging storms, an interior made with water under such high pressures it creates a solid called “hot ice,” and a gravitational influence that shapes the outer solar system. It also has a moon a bit bigger than Pluto called Triton that orbits backwards and has geysers on the surface. Triton may even have a deep ocean under its surface and is likely a captured Kuiper Belt Object, meaning it may have an origin similar to Pluto’s. 4. Venus
There’s always a plan to go to Venus. Those plans always seem to fall through. Despite being close to us in proximity and size, we still know so little about this smoggy, hot world and whether it went from possibly habitable to a hellish landscape. The only probe there right now is JAXA’s Akatsuki, which has had a rough go of it after failing an orbital insertion. A dedicated flagship mission with a lander and atmospheric probes and maybe even a rover could unlock what’s under those clouds if we can build crafts to withstand the heat.

It has moons with 12-mile-high cliffs, a little-understood ring system, an on-and-off magnetic field, and aurora activity like we’ve never seen.  You could say we have a lot to learn about Uranus.  2. Neptune
Neptune and Uranus are two very different worlds — both from each other and from the two gas giants in our solar system. Neptune has violent raging storms, an interior made with water under such high pressures it creates a solid called “hot ice,” and a gravitational influence that shapes the outer solar system. It also has a moon a bit bigger than Pluto called Triton that orbits backwards and has geysers on the surface. Triton may even have a deep ocean under its surface and is likely a captured Kuiper Belt Object, meaning it may have an origin similar to Pluto’s. 4. Venus
There’s always a plan to go to Venus. Those plans always seem to fall through. Despite being close to us in proximity and size, we still know so little about this smoggy, hot world and whether it went from possibly habitable to a hellish landscape. The only probe there right now is JAXA’s Akatsuki, which has had a rough go of it after failing an orbital insertion. A dedicated flagship mission with a lander and atmospheric probes and maybe even a rover could unlock what’s under those clouds if we can build crafts to withstand the heat.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: With the launch of three missions to Mars this summer (including a new NASA rover, Perseverance, that will look for signs of life), our exploration of the Red Planet will soon leap to new heights. And there are good reasons we should be obsessed with it: Mars is the only extraterrestrial world besides the moon that human beings could conceivably reach within a generation. If we dream about visiting other worlds, Mars is realistic. It also makes sense from a scientific perspective. Suniti Karunatillake, a planetary scientist at Louisiana State University, argues that it is the only other rocky planet in the solar system that has evidence for most of the key geological processes we find on Earth today, such as volcanoes, sedimentary rock formations, and polar ice caps made of water.  But it might be time to reassess whether our obsession is causing us to ignore the rest of our solar system. Enthusiasm over Mars tends to foster a feedback loop where more resources are devoted to exploring the planet, which unveils new findings that only add to the interest, causing the public and private sectors to devote more money to Mars exploration, and so forth.  Mars is important to study, sure—but there are many compelling reasons to start ramping up exploration of other relatively nearby worlds. Here are five alternative places we should study in greater detail, from the nearest to farthest. Venus is a cautionary tale about what could have been Earth’s fate had things gone just a bit differently. The planets are similar in size, mass, and geological composition. They seem to have similar geological histories, too, especially when it comes to volcanic activity (some data suggests Venus still has active volcanoes). Like Mars, Venus seems to have once grown and evolved on a path similar to our own. Today, however, Venus has one of the densest atmospheres of all planets we’ve ever studied, composed of more than 96% carbon dioxide. Pressure at the surface is the equivalent of being 3,000 feet underwater on Earth. The temperature on the ground comes out to 464 °C, hotter than Mercury. Greenhouse gases have run amok and made it totally inhospitable—perhaps an extreme version of what Earth could look like in the very distant future. Mystery surrounds Venus because it is difficult to study. Clouds of sulfuric acid shroud the surface from space-based observation, and the extreme heat and pressure destroy most electronics and landing gear in a very short time. That means radar has been one of the only ways we’ve been able to study the surface. ESA’s Venus Express mission, launched in 2005, was the last major mission to successfully study the planet in detail, and the Soviet Union’s Vega missions in 1985 were the last major landers sent to Venus. “For this reason, the literature is comparably less detailed compared to Mars,” says Karunatillake. “It’s prevented scientists from studying the planet in depth and mentoring future generations to continue along the same investigations.”  Maybe that will change soon. There have been new proposals over the last few years to explore Venus, the most high-profile ones being DAVINCI+ (a probe that would study the atmosphere) and VERITAS (an orbiter that would use new instruments to map the surface). One of those proposals could be approved next year and developed into an actual mission later in the decade. Given the costs of building instruments that are fortified against the planet’s challenges, things might really come down to whether lawmakers think there’s enough bang for the buck.  Ceres is a world that defies expectations. It’s the largest asteroid in the solar system, so large that it’s categorized as a dwarf planet. Although it’s an asteroid, its geology is compelling and diverse. There’s a crust that could be 30% ice, and it may be home to a salty underground ocean (or several); it has a weak atmosphere, produced by water vapor that’s exposed to sunlight; and it’s got cryovolcanoes (or ice volcanoes) that spit out water ice and salts. Factor in the presence of organic compounds, and the idea that Ceres was once habitable—or may be currently habitable—is not out of the question.  The only major effort to explore Ceres up close was NASA’s Dawn spacecraft, which traveled to Ceres in 2015. Dawn observed Ceres from orbit for three years, until it ran out of fuel in November 2018. Scientists are still analyzing the data that came from that mission, so there’s not really much urgency yet to follow up with a new visit. But the insights coming out mean there will likely be some new pressure to return with more advanced instrumentation. One international group of scientists is already proposing a mission called Calathus that would collect a sample from Ceres’s Occator crater to help assess how habitable the dwarf planet really is.  Let’s be blunt: Europa, the fourth-biggest moon orbiting Jupiter, is probably the best place in the solar system to look for extraterrestrial life. It’s likely home to a subsurface ocean of liquid water, kept warm through tidal forces, and although Europa would still be a very extreme world, it could host life in the same ways as hydrothermal vents deep in Earth’s oceans. Clay-like minerals often associated with organic matter on Earth have been found on Europa, raising even more hopes that we might be able to detect ongoing biological activity on the Jovian moon.  We’re long overdue for an actual visit. We’ve pulled off numerous flybys from passing spacecraft, and the Galileo space probe that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003 provided a fair amount of observation from a distance. But with so many recent insights hyping more of Europa’s astrobiological potential, a mission dedicated to exploring it is more important than ever.  Luckily, we now have two new missions to look forward to. ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is scheduled to launch in 2022 and pull off two flybys of Europa on its way to Ganymede. The marquee mission, however, is NASA’s Europa Clipper, which should launch in 2024. Clipper will orbit Jupiter, but will conduct about 45 flybys of Europa and use a suite of instruments to characterize the surface and subsurface as much as possible. If there’s life in that ocean, Clipper might be able to find the evidence we’re looking for. When it comes to exciting moons, the runner-up to Europa is Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second-largest moon in the solar system. It’s the only moon in the solar system with a dense nitrogen-rich atmosphere like Earth’s, and the only place besides Earth where there’s been clear evidence of lakes on the surface. But these lakes aren’t made of water—on Titan, they’re made of methane. It’s possible that primitive life might be able to thrive in these environments just as they would in bodies of liquid water. This would require inhaling hydrogen instead of oxygen, metabolizing it with acetylene instead of glucose, and exhaling methane instead of carbon dioxide. Scientists also think the atmosphere has likely encouraged the formation of organic compounds on Titan, another boost to hopes for life.  But we’ve just never been able to prove out exactly how habitable Titan might be, and whether it’s in possession of any other organic compounds that would help life to evolve. Some of our best data for Titan came from the Cassini probe that studied the Saturnian system for about 13 years. That mission included the Huygens lander, which delivered observations from the atmosphere and surface of Titan before going offline just 90 minutes after touchdown.  NASA is planning a new mission for 2026 called Dragonfly, in which a rotorcraft drone is to fly around Titan and study the moon’s potential hospitability to life in greater detail.  The planet turned dwarf planet is pretty much an ice ball, with a surface that’s 98% frozen nitrogen and mountains made of water ice. But in spite of all this, a 2015 flyby from NASA’s New Horizons probe suggests it’s one of the most eccentric and unexpectedly active planets in the solar system. It displays a wide range of colors, from icy white to charcoal black to deep red, and is internally hotter than expected—which could mean it sustains a subsurface ocean of liquid water under the crust. It has a thin atmosphere that includes methane, and data shows that some organic molecules were found on the surface. While actual life on Pluto is highly unlikely, the mere presence of the ingredients for life is quite remarkable.  In studying Pluto, “we can get a sense of what goes on in the Kuiper belt, and how it’s able to produce these geologically active bodies that are so small and distant from the sun but still have enough internal energy to drive these processes,” says Karunatillake. Pluto could be a sign that just because another world is far away from the sun doesn’t mean it’s completely dead. As with Ceres, however, there just hasn’t been enough time since the last mission to justify greenlighting a new one yet. We may need to wait another decade before NASA or another institution thinks it’s time to launch another spacecraft to Pluto.  A fine handed to the US TV firm Dish by the FCC could help kick-start the market for solutions to space debris. Scientists are training machine-learning models and designing instruments to hunt for life on other worlds. SpaceBorn United wants to conduct an IVF experiment in Earth’s orbit to pave the way for long-term space missions.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.  If you had a few billion dollars and some of the most talented space scientists and engineers in the world, where would you go? There's no wrong answer, really. Even if you narrow it down to just the outer solar system — planets, moons, rings and other cosmic rubble — you'll never get bored. But that abundance of solar system destinations has downsides, of course, since there's little chance of ever flying all the missions scientists can dream of. But dreaming up those missions anyway is a vital piece of space exploration, and one that scientists do regularly. During a recent virtual meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG), a science advisory group focused on everything past the asteroid belt, scientists walked the audience through three different mission concept studies that were commissioned to inform the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, which will guide NASA programs between 2023 and 2032. Related: 25 weirdest facts about the solar system The decadal survey, managed by the National Academies of Sciences, gives NASA an independent assessment of the priorities of the scientific community and guidance in assessing where to send larger and smaller missions. And for the panel putting together the decadal survey, it's easier to evaluate those priorities with a picture of what sort of science is on offer at different locations. "To be honest, I'd be shocked if the exact incarnation of these mission studies were to fly," Shannon MacKenize, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland and lead author of one of the mission concept studies, said of the project during the question and answer period on Sept. 2. "They're really meant to demonstrate the possibilities and the scope and are not mission proposals." All three concept studies examined the category of mission that NASA calls flagship — projects like the Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance, the Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Cassini mission to Saturn. They're big missions, with massive price tags (Perseverance cost $2.7 billion) and science agendas alike, meaning NASA certainly can't take on three at a time. But even if none of these specific missions fly, they could still shape where spacecraft go in future decades, just by offering a tantalizing look at what sort of science is really feasible. So let's take a spin through the most daring dreams in outer solar system science.  Stop one: Saturn's icy, outburst-prone moon, Enceladus, which is one of scientists' top targets for searching for life in the solar system. The Cassini mission, which ended in 2017, found compelling evidence of salty plumes spitting out of the moon's icy shell, making it much easier to sample the hidden ocean than would be true of a less temperamental world. But no mission has ever prioritized this small moon, which is why scientists designed a mission concept dubbed Enceladus Orbilander. Led by MacKenize, the researchers wanted to send a mission that could tell potentially tell scientists whether the moon hosts life. Orbilander represents two spacecraft in one. The spacecraft would orbit first Saturn to tour its moons, then Enceladus for 200 days, studying the world at a distance and collecting material spat out by the moon's distinctive geysers to analyze in its internal chemistry labs. "Every time we fly through the plume, we build up an amount of sample," MacKenzie said. "Once we have enough to run a given subset, we take some time off from doing remote sensing and dedicate a couple orbits to doing the life-detection suite." Then, Orbilander would settle down onto the surface for a second phase of operations, collecting the material that snows back to the icy crust and scooping some up for additional analysis for 150 days more. The mission's dual approach would allow Orbilander to study the material in Enceladus' plumes in a variety of forms — larger and smaller particles, fresher material and that which has been out in the open for longer. The hypothetical mission would launch in the late 2030s, arrive at the Saturn system in the mid 2040s, enter orbit around Enceladus in 2050 and land the next year. It would be packed with a host of instruments designed to tell scientists whether there is life on this tantalizing moon, including mass spectrometers that can identify materials and a microscope to enhance the scientists' view. The team priced the mission idea out to about $2.5 billion, MacKenzie said during the meeting.  Venture a bit farther out into the solar system and a different sort of opportunity awaits: the chance to visit an understudied planet and its strange, stolen moon. Neptune and its moon Triton make a compelling pair of targets, since no ice giant has ever had a dedicated spacecraft mission. Scientists suspect that Neptune's largest moon is an object trapped from the Kuiper Belt fringing the planets of our solar system, rather than a locally born moon. But in orbit around Neptune, Triton is easier to reach than its siblings still banished to the Kuiper Belt proper. "This is an important part of the buffet of options that are available to us as we decide how to visit the only class of planet in our solar system that hasn't yet had a dedicated orbital mission," Abigail Rymer, a space physicist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said during the presentation. The mission concept study she led would arrive at Triton while the sun is shining on its southern hemisphere, since that's how the Neptunian moon appeared when Voyager 2 flew past the system in 1989 and scientists want to be able to compare the same terrain over time. Voyager 2 saw what look like a few active and many former plumes on Triton, and scientists want to understand how such features work. In addition to studying Neptune, its rings and Triton, the mission concept, which the team dubbed Odyssey, would also study the strange magnetic field created by Neptune and how it interacts with the moon and its potential outflow. Odyssey would spend four years touring through the Neptune system, studying both the ice giant and its strange moon, and would cost about $3.4 billion, Rymer said. The journey out to Neptune would take about 16 years, during which the spacecraft could study the sun's influence on the solar system, study our neighbors as if they were exoplanets and perhaps fly past some asteroids.  The third mission concept study targeted the former most-distant planet, Pluto, and its neighbors. Building on the legacy of the New Horizons flyby of the dwarf planet in 2015, this mission concept, dubbed Persephone, would orbit the tiny world, in particular to tell scientists whether it hides an internal ocean. Such a subsurface ocean, something that is not usually associated with the icy outer reaches of the solar system, could be an indicator of a potential habitable environment. "If tiny Pluto on the edge of our solar system could be an ocean world, then maybe they're more ubiquitous than we expected," Carly Howett, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado and lead author of the Persephone mission concept study, said during a presentation. The New Horizons flyby offered a tempting glance at the surface of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. But a longer stay would be necessary for scientists to gather enough data to understand what the two bodies look like right now and how they got that way. That science could include studying the atmospheres of these bodies, determining whether Pluto has a magnetic field and establishing what the dwarf planet might look like below the surface. Like its predecessor, Persephone would also seek to fly past one or more Kuiper Belt objects. New Horizons' flyby of the object called Arrokoth was scientists' first glimpse of what such an ancient body could look like. Of the three mission concept studies, the $3 billion Persephone would require perhaps the most patience: With a launch in 2030, it will take at least 26 years to get out to Pluto, and 27 if the spacecraft makes a small detour to visit a Kuiper Belt object before the rendezvous. After arriving, the spacecraft would spend a bit over three years orbiting Pluto and its moons; depending on its fuel reserves, scientists would hope to send the spacecraft to visit a second Kuiper Belt object, arriving perhaps in the 2070s. While Enceladus is a bit less challenging as a destination, the Odyssey and Persephone mission concepts highlight two key issues that would-be outer solar system explorers will face in the coming decades. The first is that the usual approach for traveling so far, flinging around Jupiter to pick up some speed, won't work very well for launches after the early 2030s due to how Jupiter aligns with the other planets. "Jupiter doesn't play nicely in the next decade if you want to get to the outer solar system," Howett said. That inconvenience means that either scientists need approval to start designing missions now or spacecraft will need more powerful rockets and longer cruise times to arrive at their destinations. The second issue facing future outer-planet missions is that spacecraft bound for the deep solar system typically can't get their energy from the sun. That means scientists want to use nuclear-powered batteries to run their spacecraft. The Enceladus Orbilander mission design calls for two of these nuclear generators, called Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators; Odyssey would need three and Persephone five. But the U.S. only recently began producing spacecraft-ready plutonium again after decades out of the practice, and current plans don't include enough production quickly enough to meet the desires of planetary scientists. The challenges of Jupiter's deadline and plutonium production act as bookends narrowing the launch window for upcoming missions to the outer solar system, increasing the urgency of making decisions about which spacecraft to send where.

If you had a few billion dollars and some of the most talented space scientists and engineers in the world, where would you go? There&#x27;s no wrong answer, really. Even if you narrow it down to just the outer solar system — planets, moons, rings and other cosmic rubble — you&#x27;ll never get bored. But that abundance of solar system destinations has downsides, of course, since there&#x27;s little chance of ever flying all the missions scientists can dream of. But dreaming up those missions anyway is a vital piece of space exploration, and one that scientists do regularly. During a recent virtual meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG), a science advisory group focused on everything past the asteroid belt, scientists walked the audience through three different mission concept studies that were commissioned to inform the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, which will guide NASA programs between 2023 and 2032. Related: 25 weirdest facts about the solar system The decadal survey, managed by the National Academies of Sciences, gives NASA an independent assessment of the priorities of the scientific community and guidance in assessing where to send larger and smaller missions. And for the panel putting together the decadal survey, it&#x27;s easier to evaluate those priorities with a picture of what sort of science is on offer at different locations. &quot;To be honest, I&#x27;d be shocked if the exact incarnation of these mission studies were to fly,&quot; Shannon MacKenize, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland and lead author of one of the mission concept studies, said of the project during the question and answer period on Sept. 2. &quot;They&#x27;re really meant to demonstrate the possibilities and the scope and are not mission proposals.&quot; All three concept studies examined the category of mission that NASA calls flagship — projects like the Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance, the Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Cassini mission to Saturn. They&#x27;re big missions, with massive price tags (Perseverance cost $2.7 billion) and science agendas alike, meaning NASA certainly can&#x27;t take on three at a time. But even if none of these specific missions fly, they could still shape where spacecraft go in future decades, just by offering a tantalizing look at what sort of science is really feasible. So let&#x27;s take a spin through the most daring dreams in outer solar system science.  Stop one: Saturn&#x27;s icy, outburst-prone moon, Enceladus, which is one of scientists&#x27; top targets for searching for life in the solar system. The Cassini mission, which ended in 2017, found compelling evidence of salty plumes spitting out of the moon&#x27;s icy shell, making it much easier to sample the hidden ocean than would be true of a less temperamental world. But no mission has ever prioritized this small moon, which is why scientists designed a mission concept dubbed Enceladus Orbilander. Led by MacKenize, the researchers wanted to send a mission that could tell potentially tell scientists whether the moon hosts life. Orbilander represents two spacecraft in one. The spacecraft would orbit first Saturn to tour its moons, then Enceladus for 200 days, studying the world at a distance and collecting material spat out by the moon&#x27;s distinctive geysers to analyze in its internal chemistry labs. &quot;Every time we fly through the plume, we build up an amount of sample,&quot; MacKenzie said. &quot;Once we have enough to run a given subset, we take some time off from doing remote sensing and dedicate a couple orbits to doing the life-detection suite.&quot; Then, Orbilander would settle down onto the surface for a second phase of operations, collecting the material that snows back to the icy crust and scooping some up for additional analysis for 150 days more. The mission&#x27;s dual approach would allow Orbilander to study the material in Enceladus&#x27; plumes in a variety of forms — larger and smaller particles, fresher material and that which has been out in the open for longer. The hypothetical mission would launch in the late 2030s, arrive at the Saturn system in the mid 2040s, enter orbit around Enceladus in 2050 and land the next year. It would be packed with a host of instruments designed to tell scientists whether there is life on this tantalizing moon, including mass spectrometers that can identify materials and a microscope to enhance the scientists&#x27; view. The team priced the mission idea out to about $2.5 billion, MacKenzie said during the meeting.  Venture a bit farther out into the solar system and a different sort of opportunity awaits: the chance to visit an understudied planet and its strange, stolen moon. Neptune and its moon Triton make a compelling pair of targets, since no ice giant has ever had a dedicated spacecraft mission. Scientists suspect that Neptune&#x27;s largest moon is an object trapped from the Kuiper Belt fringing the planets of our solar system, rather than a locally born moon. But in orbit around Neptune, Triton is easier to reach than its siblings still banished to the Kuiper Belt proper. &quot;This is an important part of the buffet of options that are available to us as we decide how to visit the only class of planet in our solar system that hasn&#x27;t yet had a dedicated orbital mission,&quot; Abigail Rymer, a space physicist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said during the presentation. The mission concept study she led would arrive at Triton while the sun is shining on its southern hemisphere, since that&#x27;s how the Neptunian moon appeared when Voyager 2 flew past the system in 1989 and scientists want to be able to compare the same terrain over time. Voyager 2 saw what look like a few active and many former plumes on Triton, and scientists want to understand how such features work. In addition to studying Neptune, its rings and Triton, the mission concept, which the team dubbed Odyssey, would also study the strange magnetic field created by Neptune and how it interacts with the moon and its potential outflow. Odyssey would spend four years touring through the Neptune system, studying both the ice giant and its strange moon, and would cost about $3.4 billion, Rymer said.
