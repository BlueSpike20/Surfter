It is common at this time of year to reevaluate and search for new strategies to manage, minimize and recycle chemical waste for a better report next year. In fact, implementing a cost-effective waste minimization and recycling program can result in benefits for the environment and your company. These include: For companies using TRI-listed chemicals, contacting consulting experts at Enviro-Safe Resource Recovery about waste minimization and proper recycling / disposal programs can be particularly beneficial. While many types of commercial and industrial activities cause waste, three industry sectors account for 72 percent of the reported quantities of TRI chemicals disposed of or otherwise released in 2017. Here are the top three generators of TRI-listed chemicals that may benefit most from proper waste minimization and recycling programs.  According to EPA data, the electric utilities industry sector accounted for 9 percent of all TRI chemicals reported last year. Electric utilities generate, transmit and distribute electric power. The primary toxic chemicals reported by the industry are those fuels which are used to generate power, namely coal and oil. With thorough recycling programs, it is possible to safely manage and store used oils to protect employees health. Recyclable chemicals that appeared in EPA reports included Ethylene Glycol (EG), Methanol, Toluene, Xylene and more. At Enviro-Safe, our knowledgeable and experienced staff of professionals manage the recycling, safe disposal and transportation of toxic chemicals.  Chemical manufacturing accounted for the second highest spot at thirteen percent on the EPA’s list. Chemical manufacturers produce industrial chemicals and convert raw materials like metals, natural gas, and minerals into thousands of products. Some of these products are used for commercial and manufacturing purposes, such as plastics, while some are produced for home use, such as cosmetics. From acetone to hydrogen peroxide to xylene, a chemical manufacturing company’s failure to properly dispose of or report toxic chemical releases could result in a variety of devastating consequences to humans and the environment. Many chemicals used and created by chemical manufacturers are known to cause birth defects or cancer, can create public health crises by entering the water supply, resulting in risks to employees health. But waste minimization techniques and recycling programs like those offered at Enviro-Safe can help. Our experts help your company reduce chemical waste through improved audits, better inventory management, equipment modifications, updated production and maintenance processes and more. We can also assist with hazardous chemical substitution or find secondary markets for slightly used chemicals, or used as supplemental fuels. In fact, the EPA reports many companies are trending towards resource recovery; in 2017, only 3 percent of this sector's waste was released while the rest was managed through treatment, energy recovery, and recycling.    Metal mining far exceeded any other industry in terms of TRI-listed chemicals, accounting for a whopping 50 percent of all toxic chemical releases on the EPA’s list. Unfortunately, chemical waste from metal mining activity is extremely difficult to recycle. In fact, the EPA reported 97 percent of the metal mining sector's production-related waste from 2017 was disposed of or otherwise released rather than recycled. The majority of this waste consisted of metals, with zinc and lead compounds at the top of the list. But this does not mean companies in the metal mining industry cannot benefit from recycling. Chemicals used to maintain machinery or as organic solvents in metal mining such as methanol or toluene are TRI-listed chemicals the EPA and States monitor. Metal mining companies must also adhere to Federal and State workplace safety standards. Enviro-Safe respects the generator and strives to go above and beyond Federal and State regulations while saving you money. All said, 98 percent of everything we touch is recycled. Recycling and waste minimization are ultimately the best ways to deal with hazardous and non-hazardous waste and protect the environment and human health. Working with recycling experts will ease the reporting burden on your employees and save you money. *We respect your privacy and do not tolerate spam.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: ChemSec identifies the top 12 PFAS producers in the world and reveals shocking societal costs PRESS RELEASE: The global societal costs of PFAS chemicals amount to €16 trillion per year  Published on 22 May 2023  The issue of PFAS chemicals, used for decades in many consumer products, has gained more and more attention among the public, media and policymakers. These toxic chemicals are in our water, environment, and even bodies.  Despite the urgency of the issue, there’s a shortage of information regarding which companies are the biggest producers of PFAS, how big the industry is and the societal cost of PFAS pollution. Through investigative efforts, the NGO ChemSec now reveals that the corporate profits from the production are surprisingly small – especially compared to the societal costs. And even though the magnitude of the PFAS problem is severe, only a dozen companies are responsible for most PFAS production worldwide.   In 2022, the global market size for PFAS was just over $28 billion, with estimated profits of around $4 billion[1]. You would be excused to think the profits would be much greater, given the significant problems caused by PFAS. But instead, the profits pale compared to the societal costs of these chemicals. By combining a range of studies and expert statements relating to costs connected to healthcare from exposure to PFAS and remediation of soils and water, ChemSec can reveal that the global societal costs are €16 trillion per year.  It goes without saying that the revenue and profits of PFAS are not even in the same range as the societal costs of these chemicals. Moreover, €16 trillion is a conservative estimate, excluding costs such as damages to animals or reduction of property prices. “PFAS chemicals pose a serious threat to our health and the environment. It’s crucial that we tackle this issue not only on a policy level but also on a business level. We need transparency and accountability from companies involved in PFAS production, and we need policy measures to reduce the use of these harmful chemicals”, says Anne-Sofie Bäckar, Executive Director at ChemSec.  If PFAS producers were to pay for the pollution they caused, many would go bankrupt. However, this considerable liability risk is rarely reflected in the sustainability reports of these companies.  ChemSec’s investigation of the twelve biggest PFAS producers shows that “PFAS” is rarely mentioned. In fact, seven out of twelve companies do not mention it all. Yet another three mention PFAS less than ten times. The two exceptions are 3M and Chemours, which both are involved in litigation cases due to PFAS production and are therefore required to mention this in their reporting.  As a telling contrast to the lack of mentions of PFAS, the word sustainability is collectively mentioned 1,913 times by the companies in the reports.  A central argument for keeping PFAS on the market is that these chemicals are essential in many areas, such as medicine and climate change mitigation. There is, however, a tendency to overestimate the role of PFAS as essential. For example, looking at the fluoropolymer market in the EU, a sub-category to PFAS where you find a majority of essential uses, only about 8 per cent of the total production volume goes towards the often-cited examples of renewable energy, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals (which, by the way, is exempted from the EU ban proposal). The rest goes towards transportation, textiles, electronics and cookware where there are, in most cases, viable alternatives. [1] Assuming a 16% profit margin, as communicated by American PFAS producer 3M, is a relevant industry benchmark.    ©2023 The International Chemical Secretariat. All rights reserverad.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: The female employees at the DuPont chemical company’s Washington Works plant in Parkersburg, W. Va., were not given much of an explanation in 1981 when they were all abruptly moved away from any part of the factory that produced a category of chemicals then known as C8. They certainly were not told about their eight recently pregnant coworkers who had worked with C8 and given birth that year—one of them to a baby with eye defects and just a single nostril; another to a baby who had eye and tear duct defects; and a third with C8 in its cord blood.  For any employees with any doubts, the company took pains to offer reassurances that all was well. “During the period that C8 has been used at Washington Works,” a memo to the staff read, “there is no known evidence that our employees have been exposed to C8 at levels that pose adverse health effects. There is a dose level where almost every chemical, even water, becomes poisonous. [C8] has a lower toxicity, like table salt.” C8 is today defined as two chemicals—PFOA and PFOS—that are part of a class of more than 12,000 substances known collectively as PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Also known as “forever chemicals” because that’s pretty much how long they linger in the environment, PFAS are used in thousands of products from textiles to nonstick pans to cosmetics to fire-fighting foam to food packaging, and more. The chemicals have been linked to a host of physical ills, including decreased fertility, high blood pressure in pregnant people, increased risk of certain cancers, developmental delays and low birthweight in children, hormonal disruption, high cholesterol, and reduced effectiveness of the immune system. PFAS were first developed in the 1940s and it was not until the late 1990s that the public knew about the dangers they pose. But, according to a new study published in Annals of Global Health, DuPont and 3M—the leading manufacturers of the chemicals—had preliminary evidence of PFAS toxicity as early as the 1960s, and knew broadly about the dangers the chemicals pose by 1970.  These revelations of what the two companies knew about the harms of PFAS, and when, come as a result of an analysis of records on file at the University of California San Francisco’s (UCSF) Chemical Industry Documents Library. The documents, in turn, were the product of discovery in two lawsuits: 1998’s Tennant vs. DuPont, in which the plaintiff complained that DuPont dumped more than 7,100 tons of PFOA-laced sludge onto his property; and 2002’s Leach vs. DuPont, a class action suit in which more than 80,000 West Virginia plaintiffs charged the company with contaminating the local water supply with PFOA and PFOS. Read more: All The Stuff in Your Home That Might Contain PFAS ‘Forever Chemicals’ In 2020, a team of researchers from UCSF and the University of Colorado dove into the documents, seeking to compare the industry’s silence on—and in some cases direct cover-up of—the dangers of PFAS with similar actions by the tobacco and fossil fuel industries. The parallels, they found were striking, with the PFAS manufacturers suppressing unfavorable research, distorting public disclosure of research that does leak out, withholding information from employees who might be exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS, and not disclosing evidence of PFAS dangers to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as required under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). All of this could ultimately figure into future PFAS-related lawsuits, both from plaintiffs alleging illnesses from exposure to the chemicals and from communities seeking remediation and clean-up of contaminated soil and groundwater. Certainly, the records examined by the researchers show that the companies knew the risks associated with the substances they were manufacturing. “Having access to these documents allows us to see what the manufacturers knew and when, but also how polluting industries keep critical public health information private,” said Dr. Nadia Gaber, an emergency medicine resident and the first author of the paper, in a statement. “This research is important to inform policy and move us towards a precautionary rather than a reactionary principle of chemical regulation.” In an email to TIME, DuPont—which has since diversified—said, in part: “In 2019, DuPont de Nemours was established as a new multi-industrial specialty products company. DuPont de Nemours has never manufactured PFOA or PFOS. DuPont de Nemours cannot comment on allegations contained in the UCSF paper that relate to historical … matters.” 3M sent an emailed comment as well, stating: “The paper is largely comprised of previously published documents—as evidenced by the paper’s references section, which includes citations dating back as far as 1962. 3M has previously addressed many of the mischaracterizations of these documents in previous reporting.” It was in 1961 that the dissembling around the dangers of PFAS started. That year, as the new study details, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published a report of workers in PFAS factories who fell ill after smoking cigarettes that had been contaminated with PFAS-based Teflon. Shortly after, an account surfaced of a worker on a U.S. Air Force Base who somehow came into possession of a similarly contaminated cigarette, smoked it and died on site. DuPont and the Air Force dismissed the account as a rumor—and the author of the original Canadian paper, bowing to industry and military pressure, posted a retraction, saying in part, “The Union Carbide Corporation, upon further investigation, and with the cooperation of DuPont, reported in December of last year, ‘there have been no deaths or permanent injuries known to stem from Teflon; all rumors of death are false.’” But DuPont knew better. In 1962 a company scientist conducting in-house studies on Teflon that were not released to the public conceded that the substance may be reactive to excessive heat and handling. “Teflon may not be so inert,” the scientist concluded. A non-industry paper in 1965 showed that Teflon was associated with “an epidemic of polymer fume fever,” an inhalation fever that occurs when Teflon is heated to 300° C (572° F). DuPont remained silent on those findings. Read more: The Challenge of Removing Toxic PFAS ‘Forever Chemicals’ from Drinking Water That wasn’t all the companies were learning about the products they were manufacturing. A 1961 DuPont study found that Teflon exposure led to liver enlargement in rats, with the in-house scientist recommending that the material should be handled “with extreme care” and that “contact with the skin should be strictly avoided.” In 1970, researchers at the Washington Works plant found that C8—or PFOA and PFOS—could be “highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested.” These findings were not made public either. A 1979 industry study showed opacity in the corneas of rats exposed to PFAS; and industry studies in 1979 and 1981 showed liver degeneration in rats fed both high and low doses of PFAS. Among the human studies the companies conducted, in 1994 researchers found that the half-life of C8 in the blood of employees was 1.5 to three years. The researchers nonetheless concluded from that same study that “no adverse health effects were found in 3M workers in a study of liver function in DuPont Washington Works.” But they added, “a possible increase in prostate cancers” had been reported at a different 3M plant manufacturing C8. Other findings among employees showed elevated liver enzymes in 61% of 30 workers tested, indicating inflammation and damage to cells in the liver; and both 3M and DuPont found elevated fluorine—a marker of PFAS—in the blood of employees. The higher the level of fluorine, the higher the level of PFAS, and the greater the risk of all of the illnesses associated with the chemicals. Other industry and non-industry studies from 1988 to 2020 showed a range of additional ills associated with PFAS, including testicular adenomas—or non-malignant growths; neurological damage; metabolic dysfunction; and fertility problems. As the evidence of the dangers of PFAS mounted—both from company research and independent studies—3M and DuPont began covering up what they were learning, describes the new study. In 1991, researchers unaffiliated with the companies began detecting PFAS in ground water. The companies responded with a joint press release stating: “According to studies by DuPont and 3M Corporation, C8 has no known toxic or ill health effects in humans at concentration levels detected.” In 2000, health officials in Lubeck, W. Va., found that several forms of PFAS, including C8, were present in the local drinking water. In response, DuPont reassured the officials that all was well. The officials repeated the company line publicly, stating that, “DuPont reports that it has toxicological and epidemiological data to support confidence that exposure guidelines established by DuPont are protective of human health.” But by now, the genie was out of the bottle. Researchers unaffiliated with the companies were publishing more and more studies on the risks of PFAS linking it to increased risk of certain cancers and other ills; the Tennant case had already been adjudicated and the Leach case was coming. And in 2000, 3M even announced it would no longer be manufacturing the PFAS-based fabric-protecting Scotchguard. In an in-house email discussing the announcement, a DuPont attorney acknowledged that the chemical is “too persistent in the environment and gets into our blood.” He added, “The plant recognizes it must get public first…better late than never.”  In 2002, after Leach was adjudicated, a DuPont vice president tried to enlist help from an unlikely source: the EPA. “Urgent: EPA action needed,” the vice president wrote to the agency. “We need the EPA to quickly (like first thing tomorrow) say the following…Consumer products sold under the Teflon brand are safe [and] there are no human health effects known to be caused by PFOA.” The EPA did not accommodate the company’s request. By now, of course, the dangers of PFAS are well known, with the chemical turning up in all manner of previously unexpected places, including toilet paper, menstrual products, and contact lenses. The EPA has already regulated permissible levels of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, and is working to add six more types to that list by 2026. Public demand is leading to a growing market for PFAS-free products, leaving companies like DuPont and 3M either to abandon—or at least curb—the chemicals or get left behind. As for the companies’ reputations, studies like the just-released one might make cleaning them up a difficult job. “These documents reveal clear evidence that the chemical industry knew about the dangers of PFAS and failed to let public regulators, and even their employees know the risks,” said Tracey Woodruff, director of the UCSF program on reproductive health and senior author of the paper, in a statement. “As many countries pursue legal and legislative action to curb PFAS production, we hope they are aided by the timeline of evidence presented in this paper.” Correction: The original version of this story misspelled the name of the senior author of the paper.

                    The female employees at the DuPont chemical company’s Washington Works plant in Parkersburg, W. Va., were not given much of an explanation in 1981 when they were all abruptly moved away from any part of the factory that produced a category of chemicals then known as C8. They certainly were not told about their eight recently pregnant coworkers who had worked with C8 and given birth that year—one of them to a baby with eye defects and just a single nostril; another to a baby who had eye and tear duct defects; and a third with C8 in its cord blood.  For any employees with any doubts, the company took pains to offer reassurances that all was well. “During the period that C8 has been used at Washington Works,” a memo to the staff read, “there is no known evidence that our employees have been exposed to C8 at levels that pose adverse health effects. There is a dose level where almost every chemical, even water, becomes poisonous. [C8] has a lower toxicity, like table salt.” C8 is today defined as two chemicals—PFOA and PFOS—that are part of a class of more than 12,000 substances known collectively as PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Also known as “forever chemicals” because that’s pretty much how long they linger in the environment, PFAS are used in thousands of products from textiles to nonstick pans to cosmetics to fire-fighting foam to food packaging, and more. The chemicals have been linked to a host of physical ills, including decreased fertility, high blood pressure in pregnant people, increased risk of certain cancers, developmental delays and low birthweight in children, hormonal disruption, high cholesterol, and reduced effectiveness of the immune system. PFAS were first developed in the 1940s and it was not until the late 1990s that the public knew about the dangers they pose. But, according to a new study published in Annals of Global Health, DuPont and 3M—the leading manufacturers of the chemicals—had preliminary evidence of PFAS toxicity as early as the 1960s, and knew broadly about the dangers the chemicals pose by 1970.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: A dozen major companies earned an F for failing to publicly address the growing problem of toxic chemicals that may be in the products they sell to consumers, according to the 2021 Who’s Minding the Store? A Report Card on Retailer Actions to Eliminate Toxic Chemicals.
 
      The report is a collaboration of nonprofit partner organizations, including the environmental advocacy groups Toxic-Free Future, WE ACT for Environmental Justice and Defend Our Health.
   
Dirty Dozen 2021: View the list of foods with the most and least pesticides
 
      This year’s Toxic Hall of Shame includes the well-known brands of Starbucks, Subway, Publix, Nordstrom, Ace Hardware, 7-Eleven, Sally Beauty and Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Burger King, Popeyes and Tim Hortons, a popular Canadian fast-food chain.
   
      Rounding out the list are 99 Cents Only Stores; Sobeys and Metro, which are the second and third largest food retailers in Canada; and Alimentation Couche-Tard, which operates Circle K and Couche-Tard convenience stores in the US, Canada and more than a dozen other countries worldwide.
   
      “We score companies on a curve,” said report coauthor and Mind the Store campaign director Mike Schade. 
   
      “All a company has to do to break out of an F is to get more than 15 points, and companies can earn up to 164 possible points. For example, Nordstrom earned 13 points while Target earned 105 points,” Schade said.
   
      All but two of the retailers in the so-called Toxic Hall of Shame “are repeat offenders. They deserve special dishonorable mention for having earned an F grade across multiple years of grading,” the report stated.
   
      Four of the companies failed to score a single point for public actions to adopt safer chemical policies, the report card said. Those companies were the 99 Cents Only Stores, Publix, Metro and Sally Beauty.
   
      “There may be cases where companies are not publicly disclosing progress, which is why we send them their draft scores in advance to give them an opportunity to respond to our findings and be more transparent,” Schade said. 
   
      “This year we gave companies about two months to review and respond to their draft scores. We reached out to every retailer multiple times. We also delayed the grading process given the pandemic, to give companies additional time this year to make progress,” he added.
   
      “There is really no excuse for these retail laggards to earn a failing grade,” said report coauthor and Defend Our Health executive director Mike Belliveau in a statement.
   
      “Retailers that are not properly managing chemical risks can lose the trust of their customers, lose market share to competitors, and may even risk facing significant financial and regulatory liabilities,” he said.
   
      CNN reached out several times via email and phone to the 12 companies who received an F grade, but only heard back from two.
   
      Metro communications manager Stephanie Bonk told CNN: “We are unaware of this report and do not wish to comment.” 
   
      The parent company of Burger King, RBI, responded that existing product specifications require that “all approved plastic toys and promotional drink wear not contain bisphenol A (“BPAs”), and prohibit the use of perfluorooctanoic acid (“PFOAs”) within our approved paper and packaging products.”
   
      RBI added: “We have very specific guidelines around the approved products that are used in our restaurants in order to ensure food safety. In the United States, this means ensuring our product and packaging specifications are compliant with FDA standards.”
   
      In response, Schade told CNN: “The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and several states banned BPA in some infant and children’s products many years ago, but Burger King did not disclose action on BPA until fall 2019, which we acknowledged last year.”
   
      When it comes to PFOAs, RBI’s actions “do not even go beyond regulatory compliance, as FDA already revoked the use of this chemical in food packaging. They are just saying they comply with the law,” he said.
   
Leading baby food manufacturers knowingly sold products with high levels of toxic metals, a congressional investigation found
 
      In its fifth year, the Mind the Store campaign examines and grades the practices of 50 retail chains with more than 200,000 stores combined in the United States and Canada on their efforts to reduce chemicals known to harm human health.
   
      This year’s grades were tallied on a rubric of 13 actions, including whether the company had publicly committed to a safer chemicals policy; required suppliers to document use of chemicals; kept suppliers accountable; and had reduced or eliminated chemicals or plastics of environmental and health concern within the last three years. 
   
      Phthalates, found in hundreds of auto, home, food and personal care items, have been linked to long-lasting neurodevelopmental harm in fetuses, infants and children. 
   
      These PFAS substances – perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals – are used to make carpeting, clothing, furniture and food packaging resistant to stains, water and grease damage.
   
      Called “forever” chemicals, because they do not degrade in the environment, PFAS are so widespread that levels have been detected in the blood of 97% of Americans, according to a 2015 report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   
      Research over the last decade has found exposure to PFAS to be associated with liver damage, immune disorders, cancer and endocrine disruption – meaning they mimic or interfere with the body’s natural hormonal processes. 
   
Toxic chemicals may be in fast food wrappers and take-out containers, report says
 
      Endocrine disrupters – such as the infamous pesticides DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and dioxin, plastic additives, bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates – join PFAS chemicals in being linked with developmental, reproductive, brain, immune and other problems, according to the National Institute of Environmental Sciences.
   
      The 2021 report card also had excellent news, Schade said. Despite the pressures and economic uncertainties brought on by the pandemic, some 70% of the companies improved their scores since they were first evaluated, according to the report.
   
      “In 2018, nearly half of the retailers received failing grades. But that number dropped to nearly one-third in 2019 and to one-quarter this year,” Schade said.
   
      Six retailers received high scores of A- or above, according to the report card. Apple and Target have been consistent high performers over the years, and each received an A+ this year. IKEA and Walmart each earned an A-. For the first time, Sephora and Whole Foods Market were awarded A grades, the report card said.
   
      In addition, retailers are increasingly phasing out entire classes of toxic chemicals. For example, 12 major retailers representing some 65,000 stores worldwide have now pledged to eliminate or reduce PFAS from food packaging, the report card said.
   
      Some of those actions may prove to be significant, Schade said, pointing to Walmart and McDonald’s as examples. 
   
      Walmart had previously set a goal of reducing chemicals in products by 10% by 2022. The company announced in January it was halfway to its goal.
   
Chemicals in plastics damage babies' brains and must be banned immediately, expert group says
 
      “They’ve reduced their chemical footprint by 5%,” Schade said. “While that doesn’t sound like a lot it translates to a reduction of 10 million pounds of toxic chemicals between 2017 and 2019.”
   
      In January, McDonald’s pledged to phase out all PFAS in food packaging by 2025 and is tackling the issue of bisphenols and phthalates as well. That pledge was enough to move their score from an F to a D, Schade said, adding that if those actions rippled across the industry, McDonald’s could play a key role in creating change. 
   
      “As the largest fast-food chain in the world, actions by McDonald’s could change the entire industry as suppliers scramble to meet new requirements,” Schade said.
   
      McDonalds sent this comment: “We’re proud to take another step in our product stewardship journey with our commitment to remove all added fluorinated compounds from our guest packaging materials globally by 2025.”
   
      In an “unprecedented move” in the history of the report card, Target and Rite Aid announced they will now look for toxic chemicals in beauty products marketed to women of color, including skin lightening creams, hair straighteners and relaxers, Schade said.
   
      Women of color typically use more beauty products than other races, Schade said, including skin lightening creams, hair straighteners and relaxers. 
   
      The World Health Organization has called out the dangers of mercury in skin lightening creams, while studies have found endocrine-disrupting chemicals in hair relaxers and other products marketed to women of color.
   
      Formaldehyde is released into the air as a gas when some hair solutions are applied and then processed with heat, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.
   
      “Research shows that women of color have higher levels of toxic chemicals related to beauty products in their bodies, and this is linked to higher incidences of cancer, poor infant and maternal health outcomes, learning disabilities, obesity, asthma, and other serious health concerns,” said Taylor Morton, director of environmental health and education at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, in a statement.
   
FDA must do more to regulate thousands of chemicals added to your food, petitioners say
 
      “Availability of safe and affordable consumer products marketed to Black women is an environmental justice issue,” said Mount Sinai pediatrician Dr. Maida Galvez, the founding director of the New York State Children’s Environmental Health Center, in a statement.
   
      Some of the greatest gains by companies evaluated by the report card were in the beauty and personal care sector. The report named Ulta Beauty as the most improved retailer – rising from an F result in 2019 to a C grade today. Sephora showed the greatest improvement over time, the report card found, moving from a D in 2017 to an A today. 
   
      There are several drivers for the progress seen by companies in combating toxic chemicals, Schade said, including the growing number of states who are passing regulations against the use of various chemicals in products sold in their states.
   
      “If we look at the food packaging issue for example, just in the last couple years alone, the state of Washington, Maine and New York have all passed laws banning PFAS in food packaging despite the lack of federal action,” he said. “That patchwork of state policy is helping to drive retailers and stockholders to step up and restrict chemicals.”
   
      Federal action may be forthcoming. When running for office, President Joe Biden pledged to “tackle PFAS pollution by designating PFAS as a hazardous substance, setting enforceable limits for PFAS in the Safe Drinking Water Act, prioritizing substitutes through procurement, and accelerating toxicity studies and research.”
   
High BPA levels linked to 49% greater risk of death within 10 years, study says
 
      Another reason for the progress is the “enormous” power of consumers who vote with their pocketbooks, Schade said.
   
      “Consumers today want to know that the products that they buy for their families are safe and healthy,” Schade said, adding that the campaign has an Act Now button for consumers who would like to send messages to the 12 retailers in the Toxic Hall of Shame. 
   
      “We’ve had meetings with some of these companies like Burger King and Starbucks, and some of the other companies just blow us off, ignore us and hope we’ll just go away,” Schade said. 
   
      “We’re not going anywhere, and the consumers that are demanding safer and more sustainable products, they’re not going away either,” Schade said. “So that’s why we’re calling on these dozen companies to ‘Mind the Store’ and get their act together.”

                    A dozen major companies earned an F for failing to publicly address the growing problem of toxic chemicals that may be in the products they sell to consumers, according to the 2021 Who’s Minding the Store? A Report Card on Retailer Actions to Eliminate Toxic Chemicals.
 
      The report is a collaboration of nonprofit partner organizations, including the environmental advocacy groups Toxic-Free Future, WE ACT for Environmental Justice and Defend Our Health.
   
Dirty Dozen 2021: View the list of foods with the most and least pesticides
 
      This year’s Toxic Hall of Shame includes the well-known brands of Starbucks, Subway, Publix, Nordstrom, Ace Hardware, 7-Eleven, Sally Beauty and Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Burger King, Popeyes and Tim Hortons, a popular Canadian fast-food chain.
   
      Rounding out the list are 99 Cents Only Stores; Sobeys and Metro, which are the second and third largest food retailers in Canada; and Alimentation Couche-Tard, which operates Circle K and Couche-Tard convenience stores in the US, Canada and more than a dozen other countries worldwide.
   
      “We score companies on a curve,” said report coauthor and Mind the Store campaign director Mike Schade. 
   
      “All a company has to do to break out of an F is to get more than 15 points, and companies can earn up to 164 possible points. For example, Nordstrom earned 13 points while Target earned 105 points,” Schade said.
   
      All but two of the retailers in the so-called Toxic Hall of Shame “are repeat offenders. They deserve special dishonorable mention for having earned an F grade across multiple years of grading,” the report stated.
   
      Four of the companies failed to score a single point for public actions to adopt safer chemical policies, the report card said. Those companies were the 99 Cents Only Stores, Publix, Metro and Sally Beauty.
   
      “There may be cases where companies are not publicly disclosing progress, which is why we send them their draft scores in advance to give them an opportunity to respond to our findings and be more transparent,” Schade said. 
   
      “This year we gave companies about two months to review and respond to their draft scores. We reached out to every retailer multiple times. We also delayed the grading process given the pandemic, to give companies additional time this year to make progress,” he added.
   
      “There is really no excuse for these retail laggards to earn a failing grade,” said report coauthor and Defend Our Health executive director Mike Belliveau in a statement.
   
      “Retailers that are not properly managing chemical risks can lose the trust of their customers, lose market share to competitors, and may even risk facing significant financial and regulatory liabilities,” he said.
   
      CNN reached out several times via email and phone to the 12 companies who received an F grade, but only heard back from two.
   
      Metro communications manager Stephanie Bonk told CNN: “We are unaware of this report and do not wish to comment.” 
   
      The parent company of Burger King, RBI, responded that existing product specifications require that “all approved plastic toys and promotional drink wear not contain bisphenol A (“BPAs”), and prohibit the use of perfluorooctanoic acid (“PFOAs”) within our approved paper and packaging products.”
   
      RBI added: “We have very specific guidelines around the approved products that are used in our restaurants in order to ensure food safety. In the United States, this means ensuring our product and packaging specifications are compliant with FDA standards.”
   
      In response, Schade told CNN: “The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and several states banned BPA in some infant and children’s products many years ago, but Burger King did not disclose action on BPA until fall 2019, which we acknowledged last year.”
   
      When it comes to PFOAs, RBI’s actions “do not even go beyond regulatory compliance, as FDA already revoked the use of this chemical in food packaging. They are just saying they comply with the law,” he said.
   
Leading baby food manufacturers knowingly sold products with high levels of toxic metals, a congressional investigation found
 
      In its fifth year, the Mind the Store campaign examines and grades the practices of 50 retail chains with more than 200,000 stores combined in the United States and Canada on their efforts to reduce chemicals known to harm human health.
   
      This year’s grades were tallied on a rubric of 13 actions, including whether the company had publicly committed to a safer chemicals policy; required suppliers to document use of chemicals; kept suppliers accountable; and had reduced or eliminated chemicals or plastics of environmental and health concern within the last three years. 
   
      Phthalates, found in hundreds of auto, home, food and personal care items, have been linked to long-lasting neurodevelopmental harm in fetuses, infants and children. 
   
      These PFAS substances – perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals – are used to make carpeting, clothing, furniture and food packaging resistant to stains, water and grease damage.
   
      Called “forever” chemicals, because they do not degrade in the environment, PFAS are so widespread that levels have been detected in the blood of 97% of Americans, according to a 2015 report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   
      Research over the last decade has found exposure to PFAS to be associated with liver damage, immune disorders, cancer and endocrine disruption – meaning they mimic or interfere with the body’s natural hormonal processes. 
   
Toxic chemicals may be in fast food wrappers and take-out containers, report says
 
      Endocrine disrupters – such as the infamous pesticides DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and dioxin, plastic additives, bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates – join PFAS chemicals in being linked with developmental, reproductive, brain, immune and other problems, according to the National Institute of Environmental Sciences.
   
      The 2021 report card also had excellent news, Schade said. Despite the pressures and economic uncertainties brought on by the pandemic, some 70% of the companies improved their scores since they were first evaluated, according to the report.
   
      “In 2018, nearly half of the retailers received failing grades. But that number dropped to nearly one-third in 2019 and to one-quarter this year,” Schade said.
   
      Six retailers received high scores of A- or above, according to the report card. Apple and Target have been consistent high performers over the years, and each received an A+ this year. IKEA and Walmart each earned an A-. For the first time, Sephora and Whole Foods Market were awarded A grades, the report card said.
   
      In addition, retailers are increasingly phasing out entire classes of toxic chemicals. For example, 12 major retailers representing some 65,000 stores worldwide have now pledged to eliminate or reduce PFAS from food packaging, the report card said.
   
      Some of those actions may prove to be significant, Schade said, pointing to Walmart and McDonald’s as examples. 
   
      Walmart had previously set a goal of reducing chemicals in products by 10% by 2022. The company announced in January it was halfway to its goal.
   
Chemicals in plastics damage babies&#x27; brains and must be banned immediately, expert group says
 
      “They’ve reduced their chemical footprint by 5%,” Schade said. “While that doesn’t sound like a lot it translates to a reduction of 10 million pounds of toxic chemicals between 2017 and 2019.”
   
      In January, McDonald’s pledged to phase out all PFAS in food packaging by 2025 and is tackling the issue of bisphenols and phthalates as well. That pledge was enough to move their score from an F to a D, Schade said, adding that if those actions rippled across the industry, McDonald’s could play a key role in creating change. 
   
      “As the largest fast-food chain in the world, actions by McDonald’s could change the entire industry as suppliers scramble to meet new requirements,” Schade said.
   
      McDonalds sent this comment: “We’re proud to take another step in our product stewardship journey with our commitment to remove all added fluorinated compounds from our guest packaging materials globally by 2025.”
   
      In an “unprecedented move” in the history of the report card, Target and Rite Aid announced they will now look for toxic chemicals in beauty products marketed to women of color, including skin lightening creams, hair straighteners and relaxers, Schade said.
   
      Women of color typically use more beauty products than other races, Schade said, including skin lightening creams, hair straighteners and relaxers.

REUTERS/Robert Pratta  Acquire Licensing Rights LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Investors managing $4.1 trillion in assets are urging the world's biggest chemicals companies to phase out production of hazardous substances which linger in the environment and have been linked to serious health problems. The move by 23 investors including Aviva Investors (AV.L) and Storebrand (STB.OL) comes as regulators toughen rules around their use and as analysts warn some companies could face billions of dollars in associated clean-up and compensation costs. In a letter to the world's 50-biggest chemical producers with combined revenues of $860 billion the investors call for increased transparency around how many "substances of very high concern" they produce every year. Whilst U.S. and European regulators have disclosure requirements on hazardous chemicals, many other countries do not, and information on the volumes produced globally are not publically available. To help investors, companies should also share the data with the non-profit International Chemical Secretariat (ICS), which advocates for a shift to safer chemicals and tracks the performance of leading producers, the letter seen by Reuters said. "We believe sustainable management of chemicals is key to financial outperformance," Eugenie Mathieu, senior analyst at Aviva Investors, told Reuters, citing the example of litigation tied to PFAS or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, used in applications such as lubrication and industrial coatings. So-called "persistent chemicals" such as PFAS - which degrade slowly and are linked to a range of illnesses after getting into local water supplies - have already led to payouts from companies including 3M(MMM.N), and more cases are pending. "In recent years the financial implications for (a) company's liability for past and current production of pollution of persistent chemicals, especially PFAS, have been clear," she added, citing one analyst's estimate of potential costs in the United States of between $25 billion and $40 billion. A spokesperson for 3M, one of the companies to receive the letter, said the company was committed to environmental stewardship, adding: "We welcome the opportunity to engage with investors and other stakeholders regarding this topic". Belgian company Umicore (UMI.BR) said it had engaged with ICS over the group's ChemScore questionnaire in October and complies with relevant legislation where it makes, imports or sells its products, using a "risk-based" approach to chemicals management. Given the growing regulatory and litigation concerns, the investors said they wanted to see all companies make a time-linked commitment to phase out production of the chemicals, focusing first on persistent chemicals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year laid out a plan to toughen rules for persistent chemicals, while the European Union is also looking to tighten legislation and incentivise a transition towards less hazardous materials. Lastly, the investors said companies should set out plans to develop products that can be reused as part of a "circular economy", or which allow customers to design products that can be used in such a way - a key focus of EU lawmakers. "The chemical industry sits at the start of the supply chain so has a role to play in driving the circular economy forward," the letter said, citing examples such as using waste or bio-based material as feedstocks.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Indiana released a chemical soup of toxins into the environment last year — 133 million pounds of them, to be exact.  The amount is the equivalent weight of roughly 950,000 American adults, or the population of Marion County, and made Indiana sixth in the country in terms of toxic release.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires large industrial facilities to report their toxic releases into the environment every year. Priceonomics, a group that analyzes and shares data, worked with one of their customers to examine the EPA's Toxic Releases Inventory and its recently added 2016 data. That customer, Ode, creates environmentally conscious cleaning products. With a handful of the nation's most toxin-producing companies in Hoosiers' backyards, it may come as no surprise that Indiana and several of its cities and counties near the tops of lists for their chemical releases. Here's what you need to know:  • Indiana released more toxic chemicals into the environment in 2016 than 44 other states. At 133 million pounds, that is more than any neighboring Midwest states. Alaska topped the list, emitting 834 million pounds, followed by Nevada, Utah, Texas and Louisiana. New Hampshire released the fewest toxins, only 290,000 pounds.  • Marion County is among the top 50 counties in the U.S. that produce the most toxins, releasing nearly 11 million pounds into the environment in 2016. Three other Indiana counties find themselves on the list, including Lake County — home of Gary —  in the top 10, as well as Spencer and Posey counties.  • Of the country's 50 most populous cities, Indianapolis leads the pack with 10.9 million pounds of toxic releases. Houston came in second with 6.6 million pounds. Indiana's capital also beat out Chicago, Detroit and Louisville, Ky., among others. With its history in manufacturing and known for its coal power plants, steel mills and auto factories, Indianapolis has long been cited for its poor air quality.  • Indianapolis also produced some of the most toxins per capita and per square mile last year, finding itself in the top 10 when measured against the 100 most populous U.S. cities. More specifically, nearly 13 pounds of chemicals were released per person — more than triple the average — and roughly 30,150 pounds per square mile.  • Four other Indiana cities are among the top 50 that produce the most toxins, when population is not considered. Gary — ranked 13th nationally — has the most releases in the state: 23.9 million pounds of chemicals. Also on the list are Rockport, East Chicago and Mount Vernon.  • Indiana has 916 toxin-releasing facilities, and those in the primary metals industry are some of the biggest culprits for the amount of toxins they release. This includes companies such as U.S. Steel Corp. in Gary, AK Steel Holding Corp., with a location in Rockport; and ArcelorMittal USA in East Chicago. These three companies are among the top 25 companies that produce the most pounds of toxic chemicals released into the environment nationally.  • The top five chemicals released in Indiana can damage the nervous system and cause other illnesses, as well as be toxic to wildlife. They include zinc compounds, manganese compounds, nitrate compounds, lead compounds and sulfuric acid. The zinc, manganese and lead compounds are often products of mining, while nitrate is a common byproduct from fertilizers and agriculture and sulfuric acid from manufacturing.  This information was gathered from the EPA's Toxic Releases Inventory database as well as provided by the analysis of Priceonomics and Ode.  Call IndyStar reporter Sarah Bowman at (317) 444-6129.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Shareholders say lawsuits over PFAS compounds linked to cancer and other diseases represent growing threat to companies’ profits Investors from some of the world’s largest firms are pressuring chemical companies to end production of toxic PFAS “forever chemicals”, which shareholders say represent an enormous and growing threat to manufacturers’ bottom lines. PFAS are a class of about 12,000 compounds typically used to make products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health issues. A letter circulated late last year and signed by largely European Union investment firms holding $8tn in assets cites a tsunami of recent litigation brought against PFAS manufacturers, ever-increasing regulation that imposes strict limits on the chemicals’ use, and the compounds’ public health threat. Liability for PFAS contamination “of the entire planet is expanding”, said Erik Olson, a senior strategic director with the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council. The letter was made public ahead of a decision by 3M, one of the world’s largest PFAS manufacturers, to discontinue making the chemicals by the end of 2025. “There has got to be concern in boardrooms and among knowledgable and savvy shareholders that continuing to manufacture these chemicals that are creating the Superfund sites of tomorrow is really risky for them financially,” Olson added. “If people getting sick and dying of exposure to these chemicals wasn’t enough, the liability should be.” Among the 47 investors signing on to the letter are Axa, Credit Suisse, Robeco, Aviva and Storebrand, and the letter was circulated among 54 chemical companies. The investors are demanding industry develop a plan to end their manufacture and share production data with ChemSec, a non-profit that tracks the chemical industry. “We encourage you to lead, not be led, by phasing out and substituting these chemicals,” the letter reads. “In addition to the financial risks associated with litigation, producers of persistent chemicals face the risk of increased costs associated with reformulating products and modifying processes, which can have significant implications for company performance.” Industry observers say the math on 3M’s PFAS profits and liabilities sheds light on why the chemical giant decided to phase out production, and why investors in other PFAS manufacturers are concerned over liabilities. 3M’s 2021 annual report shows about $1.3bn in PFAS sales, and details dozens of lawsuits it faces from states, local municipalities, water utilities, school districts, other companies and residents. 3M was named in an average of more than three PFAS-related lawsuits a day last year, and its legal liabilities could tally as much as $30bn. With overwhelming independent science showing the chemicals’ danger and strong evidence that 3M regularly hid those threats from customers, the company has already started settling: in late 2019, 3M agreed to pay Minnesota for $850m over PFAS pollution, and settled for another $50m the following year over contamination in Delaware. “The pressure is mounting from every direction,” said Sonja Haider, senior business and investment adviser with ChemSec, which helped coordinate the campaign. “The lawsuits won’t go away – the companies will have to cover that – and the regulatory pressure is coming,” 3M also cited new regulations that make it difficult to continue to pollute without paying a price. Among those are the designation of PFOS, a compound that 3M developed and sold for decades, as a hazardous substance. Coupled with new advisory US drinking water limits that found virtually no level of PFOS in drinking water is safe, the company faces the prospect of even more litigation and cleanup costs in the coming years. ​​“When we look forward at some of those factors, we don’t see a viable business in the future,” 3M’s chief executive, Mike Roman, told Bloomberg. “This is a portfolio decision that allows us to move into other, higher growth opportunities.” However, for now, few companies seem inclined to follow 3M’s lead. A ChemSec analysis found just four companies – Solvay, Indorama, Sabic and Yara – have a plan to phase out “hazardous chemicals”, although the plans are not specific to PFAS. Meanwhile, most of the industry has made little progress in transparency, and North American and Asian companies are faring the worst, ChemSec found. The non-profit also identified 100 downstream customers of major chemical producers who are planning to phase out their use of PFAS. Among a growing number of clothing brands no longer using the chemicals is Levi’s, while an expanding list of restaurant chains are using PFAS-free food packaging. “If your customers want alternatives, then you should hurry up and produce the alternatives,” Haider said. Support for the campaign to phase out PFAS has doubled since its launch last year, when 23 investors with $4.4tn backed a similar call. “If you get questions by huge investors who are asking, ‘Why are you doing this and do you have a phase-out plan?”, and those investors are discussing a divestment – that makes you act,” Haider said.  This article was amended on 12 January 2023. A earlier version referred to the four companies with plans to phase out hazardous chemicals as “PFAS producers”. However, not all manufacture PFAS: for example, while Yara does have a phase-out plan for chemicals, it informed that Guardian after publication that it “does not produce, use or sell PFAS”.

                    Shareholders say lawsuits over PFAS compounds linked to cancer and other diseases represent growing threat to companies’ profits Investors from some of the world’s largest firms are pressuring chemical companies to end production of toxic PFAS “forever chemicals”, which shareholders say represent an enormous and growing threat to manufacturers’ bottom lines. PFAS are a class of about 12,000 compounds typically used to make products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health issues. A letter circulated late last year and signed by largely European Union investment firms holding $8tn in assets cites a tsunami of recent litigation brought against PFAS manufacturers, ever-increasing regulation that imposes strict limits on the chemicals’ use, and the compounds’ public health threat. Liability for PFAS contamination “of the entire planet is expanding”, said Erik Olson, a senior strategic director with the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council. The letter was made public ahead of a decision by 3M, one of the world’s largest PFAS manufacturers, to discontinue making the chemicals by the end of 2025. “There has got to be concern in boardrooms and among knowledgable and savvy shareholders that continuing to manufacture these chemicals that are creating the Superfund sites of tomorrow is really risky for them financially,” Olson added. “If people getting sick and dying of exposure to these chemicals wasn’t enough, the liability should be.” Among the 47 investors signing on to the letter are Axa, Credit Suisse, Robeco, Aviva and Storebrand, and the letter was circulated among 54 chemical companies.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Creators of Skin Deep Database Tapwater Database EWG Verified The New LedeSearch By Scott Faber, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Updated Tuesday, May 5, 2020 Chemicals and contaminants linked to cancer can be found in food, water and many other everyday products. However, no category of consumer products is subject to less government oversight than cosmetics and other personal care products. Although many of the chemicals and contaminants in cosmetics and personal care products likely pose little risk, exposure to some has been linked to serious health problems, including cancer. Since 2009, 595 cosmetics manufacturers have reported using 88 chemicals, in more than 73,000 products, that have been linked to cancer, birth defects or reproductive harm.[1] Many of these chemicals should be banned from cosmetics, as proposed in California Assembly Bill 2762, the Toxic-Free Cosmetics Act. Among the toxic chemicals[2] that should be banned are: All of these toxic chemicals have been banned by the European Union and many other nations, and many have been slated for removal from the store brands of major U.S. retailers, including Target, Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS Health.[3] For example, as of the end of 2019, CVS Health prohibits the use of formaldehyde, many chemicals that release formaldehyde, many parabens, dibutyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate. Some of these are already banned from products sold in Whole Foods.[4] Some of the chemicals included in A.B. 2762 do not have to be disclosed on the package, because they are components of fragrance and so are exempt from federal labeling requirements. In particular, two phthalates included in A.B. 2762 – dibutyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate – may be included in combinations of chemicals disclosed on the label as fragrance but do not have to be disclosed as individual chemicals. Dibutyl phthalate is an endocrine disruptor and a developmental toxicant that harms male reproductive system development. It can cause early puberty in boys and other changes in the reproductive system. Diethylhexyl phthalate harms the reproductive system and can affect the developing fetus. It has also been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as possibly carcinogenic.[5] Many of these chemicals are rarely used in personal care products and will be easy to replace. For example, in Skin Deep®, EWG’s database of cosmetics and other personal care products, EWG found isobutylparaben and isopropylparaben in just 96 and 12 products, respectively, offered for sale since January 2017. A 2018 analysis by EWG found fewer than 200 products contained one of 13 PFAS chemicals.[6] The cosmetics industry has grown dramatically since 1938, when Congress last enacted cosmetics legislation, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. At that time, the cosmetics industry reported approximately $1 billion in sales.[7] In 2016, it reported more than $169 billion in sales.[8] Nevertheless, only two pages of the 829-page act governs cosmetics, and those provisions provide the Food and Drug Administration no financial resources and sharply limit its authority to regulate chemicals and contaminants that pose chronic risks.[9]  Although Congress has since then given the FDA the power to ensure that food additives,[10] color additives[11] and pesticides[12] pose “no harm” from repeat exposures, Congress has not given the agency the same authority to regulate the chronic risks posed by chemicals and contaminants in cosmetics. Instead, the FDA largely relies on the personal care products industry to regulate itself as a way to address the risks its products pose.   Consumers use a wide variety of cosmetics and personal care products. Few consumer products contribute as many chemical exposures as cosmetics and other personal care products. Each day, American women use an average of 12 personal care products that contain 168 different chemicals. Men use an average of six personal care products that contain 85 different chemicals.[13] Many of these products are applied directly to the skin, the body’s largest organ, where ingredients can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream.[14] Consumer use of cosmetics continues to grow dramatically. Since 2010, the U.S. cosmetics market has grown an average of 4.1 percent annually, and internet sales have expanded to account for 8.4 percent of the total market share.[15]  Cosmetic imports are also on the rise. In fiscal year 2016, 2.9 million lines of cosmetics were imported into the U.S. from 181 different countries.[16] Lines of cosmetic imports doubled over the past decade, with a substantial increase after FY 2011.[17] Cosmetic imports from China increased by 79 percent between FY 2011 and FY 2016. Although most chemicals in cosmetics pose little or no risk, some have been linked to serious health problems, including cancer, reproductive and neurological harm, and developmental delays. Cosmetic chemicals enter the body through the skin, inhalation, ingestion and internal use, and pose the same risks as food chemicals.[18] In addition to the risks posed by intentionally added ingredients, cosmetics can be contaminated with heavy metals, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and nickel. Some chemicals used in personal care products pose risks at very low doses[22] and can interfere with the hormone system.[23] Research shows that “endocrine disrupting” chemicals such as parabens and phthalates may pose the greatest risk during prenatal and early postnatal development, when organ and neural systems form.[24] Exposure to these chemicals has been linked to endocrine diseases and some types of cancer.[25] For example, endocrine disruptors are known to affect how women’s bodies use estrogen and thus have been linked to breast cancer.[26] Research has also shown that endocrine disruptors can harm the immune system – an effect that makes us more susceptible to disease and viruses. Many cosmetics have also been linked to acute risks, including burns and infections. Formaldehyde-based hair-straightening procedures, referred to as “keratin treatments,” have been linked to hair loss, rashes, blisters, nosebleeds, bleeding gums and loss of taste and smell.[27] Other cosmetics have caused hair loss.[28]  The FDA continues to find cosmetics contaminated with bacteria, including body wash, face powders, shadows and lotions, or containing banned colors chemicals, including shampoos, soaps, cleaners and temporary tattoos.[29] Under the current law, the FDA has little authority to review chemicals in cosmetics and other personal care products. Personal care products companies do not have to register with the FDA, provide the FDA with ingredient statements, adopt Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, report adverse events to the FDA, or provide the FDA with access to safety records. The FDA does not have the power to suspend registration or order recalls when products pose a risk of serious adverse health consequences or death. By contrast, manufacturers of food, drugs and medical devices must register with the FDA, maintain and give the FDA access to records and report adverse events. If food, drugs or devices are unsafe, the FDA can suspend production and product licenses. If unsafe food or devices reach the market, the FDA can order a recall and take legal action against drugmakers that do not recall their products.[30] Of more than 10,000 chemicals used to formulate cosmetics, just 11 have ever been banned or restricted by the federal Food and Drug Administration. By contrast, the FDA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Product Safety Commission have broad authority to ensure the safety of chemicals in other consumer products. For example, the FDA has the authority to review chemicals in prescription[31] and over-the-counter drugs,[32] and chemicals found in food,[33] and the EPA has the authority to review chemicals in pesticides used in homes and on farms[34] and to set limits for pesticide residues on food.[35] In 2016, Congress expanded EPA authority to review chemicals in cleaners, paints, solvents and many other consumer products.[36] The U.S. has also fallen far behind our international trading partners in the regulation of cosmetics. More than 40 nations have taken steps to ban or restrict, in combination, more than 1,400 chemicals or contaminants in cosmetics and personal care products, including chemicals linked to cancer, reproductive harm and neurological harm.[37]  All of the chemicals identified in A.B. 2762 have already been banned by the EU, including isopropylparaben and isobutylparaben, dibutyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate,[38] mercury,[39] formaldehyde and many PFAS. Other nations have restricted the presence of chemicals such as formaldehyde[40] and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).[41]  The cosmetics industry has long fought meaningful oversight. Since the early 1950s, it has defeated efforts by Congress to modernize cosmetics law.[42] Since 2015, some cosmetics companies have supported giving the FDA the authority and resources to review and regulate chemicals and contaminants of concern in cosmetics, and have supported requiring manufacturers to register, provide ingredient statements, adopt GMPs and report adverse events. Some companies have also supported giving FDA the power to suspend production of dangerous products and order mandatory recalls.[43] However, other companies have not supported FDA review and oversight.  Consumers overwhelmingly support federal oversight of cosmetic chemicals. Two-thirds of consumers believe chemicals in cosmetics are already reviewed by the FDA, according to polling conducted by American Viewpoint and the Mellman Group in 2016.[44] Three-fourths of consumers – regardless of age, race or party affiliation – support stricter oversight of chemicals in cosmetics, and nearly nine in 10 consider stricter rules very important. In addition, nine in 10 consumers believe cosmetic companies should have to notify the FDA if their products harm consumers; support giving the FDA mandatory recall authority; and support rules ensuring cosmetics are produced in clean environments.

                    Creators of Skin Deep Database Tapwater Database EWG Verified The New LedeSearch By Scott Faber, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Updated Tuesday, May 5, 2020 Chemicals and contaminants linked to cancer can be found in food, water and many other everyday products. However, no category of consumer products is subject to less government oversight than cosmetics and other personal care products. Although many of the chemicals and contaminants in cosmetics and personal care products likely pose little risk, exposure to some has been linked to serious health problems, including cancer. Since 2009, 595 cosmetics manufacturers have reported using 88 chemicals, in more than 73,000 products, that have been linked to cancer, birth defects or reproductive harm.[1] Many of these chemicals should be banned from cosmetics, as proposed in California Assembly Bill 2762, the Toxic-Free Cosmetics Act. Among the toxic chemicals[2] that should be banned are: All of these toxic chemicals have been banned by the European Union and many other nations, and many have been slated for removal from the store brands of major U.S. retailers, including Target, Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS Health.[3] For example, as of the end of 2019, CVS Health prohibits the use of formaldehyde, many chemicals that release formaldehyde, many parabens, dibutyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate. Some of these are already banned from products sold in Whole Foods.[4] Some of the chemicals included in A.B. 2762 do not have to be disclosed on the package, because they are components of fragrance and so are exempt from federal labeling requirements. In particular, two phthalates included in A.B. 2762 – dibutyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate – may be included in combinations of chemicals disclosed on the label as fragrance but do not have to be disclosed as individual chemicals. Dibutyl phthalate is an endocrine disruptor and a developmental toxicant that harms male reproductive system development. It can cause early puberty in boys and other changes in the reproductive system. Diethylhexyl phthalate harms the reproductive system and can affect the developing fetus. It has also been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as possibly carcinogenic.[5] Many of these chemicals are rarely used in personal care products and will be easy to replace. For example, in Skin Deep®, EWG’s database of cosmetics and other personal care products, EWG found isobutylparaben and isopropylparaben in just 96 and 12 products, respectively, offered for sale since January 2017. A 2018 analysis by EWG found fewer than 200 products contained one of 13 PFAS chemicals.[6] The cosmetics industry has grown dramatically since 1938, when Congress last enacted cosmetics legislation, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. At that time, the cosmetics industry reported approximately $1 billion in sales.[7] In 2016, it reported more than $169 billion in sales.[8] Nevertheless, only two pages of the 829-page act governs cosmetics, and those provisions provide the Food and Drug Administration no financial resources and sharply limit its authority to regulate chemicals and contaminants that pose chronic risks.[9]  Although Congress has since then given the FDA the power to ensure that food additives,[10] color additives[11] and pesticides[12] pose “no harm” from repeat exposures, Congress has not given the agency the same authority to regulate the chronic risks posed by chemicals and contaminants in cosmetics. Instead, the FDA largely relies on the personal care products industry to regulate itself as a way to address the risks its products pose.   Consumers use a wide variety of cosmetics and personal care products. Few consumer products contribute as many chemical exposures as cosmetics and other personal care products. Each day, American women use an average of 12 personal care products that contain 168 different chemicals. Men use an average of six personal care products that contain 85 different chemicals.[13] Many of these products are applied directly to the skin, the body’s largest organ, where ingredients can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream.[14] Consumer use of cosmetics continues to grow dramatically. Since 2010, the U.S. cosmetics market has grown an average of 4.1 percent annually, and internet sales have expanded to account for 8.4 percent of the total market share.[15]  Cosmetic imports are also on the rise. In fiscal year 2016, 2.9 million lines of cosmetics were imported into the U.S. from 181 different countries.[16] Lines of cosmetic imports doubled over the past decade, with a substantial increase after FY 2011.[17] Cosmetic imports from China increased by 79 percent between FY 2011 and FY 2016. Although most chemicals in cosmetics pose little or no risk, some have been linked to serious health problems, including cancer, reproductive and neurological harm, and developmental delays. Cosmetic chemicals enter the body through the skin, inhalation, ingestion and internal use, and pose the same risks as food chemicals.[18] In addition to the risks posed by intentionally added ingredients, cosmetics can be contaminated with heavy metals, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and nickel. Some chemicals used in personal care products pose risks at very low doses[22] and can interfere with the hormone system.[23] Research shows that “endocrine disrupting” chemicals such as parabens and phthalates may pose the greatest risk during prenatal and early postnatal development, when organ and neural systems form.[24] Exposure to these chemicals has been linked to endocrine diseases and some types of cancer.[25] For example, endocrine disruptors are known to affect how women’s bodies use estrogen and thus have been linked to breast cancer.[26] Research has also shown that endocrine disruptors can harm the immune system – an effect that makes us more susceptible to disease and viruses. Many cosmetics have also been linked to acute risks, including burns and infections. Formaldehyde-based hair-straightening procedures, referred to as “keratin treatments,” have been linked to hair loss, rashes, blisters, nosebleeds, bleeding gums and loss of taste and smell.[27] Other cosmetics have caused hair loss.[28]  The FDA continues to find cosmetics contaminated with bacteria, including body wash, face powders, shadows and lotions, or containing banned colors chemicals, including shampoos, soaps, cleaners and temporary tattoos.[29] Under the current law, the FDA has little authority to review chemicals in cosmetics and other personal care products. Personal care products companies do not have to register with the FDA, provide the FDA with ingredient statements, adopt Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, report adverse events to the FDA, or provide the FDA with access to safety records. The FDA does not have the power to suspend registration or order recalls when products pose a risk of serious adverse health consequences or death. By contrast, manufacturers of food, drugs and medical devices must register with the FDA, maintain and give the FDA access to records and report adverse events. If food, drugs or devices are unsafe, the FDA can suspend production and product licenses. If unsafe food or devices reach the market, the FDA can order a recall and take legal action against drugmakers that do not recall their products.[30] Of more than 10,000 chemicals used to formulate cosmetics, just 11 have ever been banned or restricted by the federal Food and Drug Administration. By contrast, the FDA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Product Safety Commission have broad authority to ensure the safety of chemicals in other consumer products. For example, the FDA has the authority to review chemicals in prescription[31] and over-the-counter drugs,[32] and chemicals found in food,[33] and the EPA has the authority to review chemicals in pesticides used in homes and on farms[34] and to set limits for pesticide residues on food.[35] In 2016, Congress expanded EPA authority to review chemicals in cleaners, paints, solvents and many other consumer products.[36] The U.S. has also fallen far behind our international trading partners in the regulation of cosmetics. More than 40 nations have taken steps to ban or restrict, in combination, more than 1,400 chemicals or contaminants in cosmetics and personal care products, including chemicals linked to cancer, reproductive harm and neurological harm.[37]  All of the chemicals identified in A.B. 2762 have already been banned by the EU, including isopropylparaben and isobutylparaben, dibutyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate,[38] mercury,[39] formaldehyde and many PFAS. Other nations have restricted the presence of chemicals such as formaldehyde[40] and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).[41]  The cosmetics industry has long fought meaningful oversight. Since the early 1950s, it has defeated efforts by Congress to modernize cosmetics law.[42] Since 2015, some cosmetics companies have supported giving the FDA the authority and resources to review and regulate chemicals and contaminants of concern in cosmetics, and have supported requiring manufacturers to register, provide ingredient statements, adopt GMPs and report adverse events. Some companies have also supported giving FDA the power to suspend production of dangerous products and order mandatory recalls.[43] However, other companies have not supported FDA review and oversight.  Consumers overwhelmingly support federal oversight of cosmetic chemicals. Two-thirds of consumers believe chemicals in cosmetics are already reviewed by the FDA, according to polling conducted by American Viewpoint and the Mellman Group in 2016.[44] Three-fourths of consumers – regardless of age, race or party affiliation – support stricter oversight of chemicals in cosmetics, and nearly nine in 10 consider stricter rules very important. In addition, nine in 10 consumers believe cosmetic companies should have to notify the FDA if their products harm consumers; support giving the FDA mandatory recall authority; and support rules ensuring cosmetics are produced in clean environments.

[23] Chemicals like phthalates and triphenyl phosphate can disrupt the hormone system by mimicking or blocking a natural hormone. When an endocrine-disrupting chemical mimics a hormone, the chemical tricks the hormone’s receptor into thinking the chemical is the hormone. When the chemical blocks a hormone, the chemical can bind to a receptor and the hormone may not be activated. See Veldhoen N et al., The bactericidal agent triclosan modulates thyroid hormone-associated gene expression and disrupts postembryonic anuran development, Aquat Toxicol (June 2007), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17011055.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: By Cadee Wambolt Published Winter 2021 Special thanks to Sam Lofgran for editing and research contributions Many of the consumer products sold in the United States contain toxic chemicals. This is due to a lack of testing and regulation, lack of knowledge of consumers, government-protected trade secrets, marketing and PR tactics, and a desire for cost efficiency and product effectiveness. Because of this, many Americans are frequently and unknowingly exposed to toxic chemicals that have been shown to cause various health issues such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, birth defects, infertility, and hormone imbalances, among other issues. These toxic chemicals have also been shown to contribute to environmental issues. One of the leading organizations combating this issue is the Environmental Working Group, which focuses on research and advocacy surrounding agriculture, water pollution, toxic chemicals, and corporate accountability. Carcinogen — “A substance or agent causing cancer.”1 Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC) — “Substances in our environment, food, and consumer products that interfere with hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, or action resulting in a deviation from normal homeostatic control or reproduction.”2 Endocrine System — “The glands and organs that make hormones and release them directly into the blood so they can travel to tissues and organs all over the body. The hormones released by the endocrine system control many important functions in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, and reproduction.”3 Grandfathering — A common business term meaning “to allow someone to do or to have something that a new law or rule makes illegal,” similar to “exempt” or “excuse.”4 Although this term has a problematic history due to its tie to slavery,5 the term will be used throughout this brief since it is the term that continues to be used in modern business practices. Greenwashing — A marketing tactic where companies put labels such as “non-toxic,” “green,” “natural,” and “eco-friendly” on their packaging to make the customer believe the product is good for the environment.6  Mutagen — “A chemical or physical agent that has the ability to change our genetic code in a harmful way . . . our body has the ability to recognize and repair these mutations.” If they escape repair they can develop into a tumor cell, therefore aiding in the development of cancer.7 PFAS — “Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that includes PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other chemicals. PFAS have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries around the globe, including in the United States since the 1940s. PFOA and PFOS have been the most extensively produced and studied of these chemicals. Both chemicals are very persistent in the environment and in the human body – meaning they don’t break down and they can accumulate over time. There is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse human health effects.” PFAS can be found in food, commercial household products, workplace environments, drinking water, and living organisms.8 Precautionary Principle — “The precautionary principle, proposed as a new guideline in environmental decision making, has four central components: taking preventive action in the face of uncertainty; shifting the burden of proof to the proponents of an activity; exploring a wide range of alternatives to possibly harmful actions; and increasing public participation in decision making.”9  Toxic — “Containing or being poisonous material especially when capable of causing death or serious debilitation.”10 Trade Secret — "Information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.”11 Q: What are toxic chemicals? A: Toxic chemicals are any substance that is harmful to the environment or human health “if inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin.” 12  Q: Why are toxic chemicals in consumer products a social issue? A: Toxins found in everyday consumer products are known to be a cause of many health issues. Due to the prevalence of toxins in many manufactured products, virtually all populations are exposed and at risk for these negative health effects. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) warns that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), a common toxin found in consumer products, represents a global health threat because they can cause diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.13 Q: Who is most affected by toxic chemicals in consumer products? A: Although toxins are a health threat for most populations, there is a known disparity in EDC exposure for people with a lower socioeconomic status (SES). Numerous studies have found that African Americans, Latinos, and low income individuals face greater exposure to diabetogenic EDCs, which may contribute to these groups having higher levels of diabetes.14 While the research has not reached a consensus as to why these disparities exist, it is possibly due to the higher expense of fresh food, and thus the higher consumption of processed foods by those of low SES; processed food often comes in packaging that increases BPA exposure.15 Though people of lower SES may have more exposure to toxic chemicals, it is still a threat to the entire population. Additionally, as most non-toxic products tend to come at premium prices, it is easier for people of higher SES to avoid these toxins by purchasing the more expensive products. Unfortunately, people of lower SES may not have that luxury as they may not have the ability or means to do so, even if they wanted to.16 This brief will focus on general exposure to toxins for most populations in the US with the general understanding that those in lower socioeconomic spheres will be more affected by each of these contributing factors and consequences than those with higher SES. Q: What are consumer products? A: “Consumer products, also referred to as final goods, are products that are bought by individuals or households for personal use. In other words, consumer products are goods that are bought for consumption by the average consumer.”17 There are four categories of consumer products: convenience products, shopping products, specialty products, and unsought products.18 See graphic for examples of these types of products. Q: What kinds of toxic chemicals are often found in consumer products? A:  Currently, there are 5 groups of chemicals that are of main concern to consumers: pesticides, phthalates, flame retardants, bisphenol (BPA), and PFAS.19 Unfortunately these chemicals are commonly found almost everywhere including, but not limited to, canned food and receipt paper containing BPA, cosmetics as they have no required safety testing and no monitoring of labeling or health effects, pesticides found on food even after washing, vinyl plastic and phthalates used in building materials, schools, hospitals, and consumer products, and flame retardants used in furniture, cars, electronics, and baby products.20 Additionally, endocrine disrupting chemicals represent a broad set of chemicals known to affect the endocrine system. EDCs are man-made chemicals; some common examples include flame retardants (BFRs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates, BPA, lead, cadmium, many pesticides and herbicides, DDT, atrazine, and PFAS.21, 22 These endocrine disruptors interfere with the function of the hormones by binding to the same sites and cells where the hormones normally bind and interfering with the normal processing. This becomes especially problematic as a disruption to hormones can cause many adverse health effects.23 Q: How many toxins are found in consumer products in the United States today? A: It is impossible to know the exact number or concentration of toxins in 
consumer products in circulation today. This, in part, is due to the fact that a lack of testing and regulation has allowed many toxic chemicals to go untested and unnoticed. Therefore, though there are many toxins still being used that have been proven to be unsafe, researchers postulate that there are many more toxic chemicals in consumer products than they know about due to a lack of testing.  There are some statistics, however, that demonstrate how widespread toxin use is in consumer products. For example, an evaluation of products at dollar stores in the US revealed that 38% of products contained the toxic plastic PVC, and 32% of these products exceeded phthalate limits established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.24 Additionally, 81% of dollar store products contained at least one hazardous chemical above the established level of concern.25 This not only indicates the widespread use of toxic chemicals in consumer products, but leads to disproportionate exposure for people of lower SES as they are more likely to purchase dollar store products due to financial limitations. Additionally, it has been revealed that most of the 80,000 chemicals currently in circulation in consumer products in the United States have not been adequately tested for safety or for their effects on human health.26 In fact, only about 1% have been studied.27 Though it is unknown how many products on the shelf contain toxic chemicals or how many toxic chemicals are in circulation, studies reveal that it is safe to assume that toxic chemicals are now commonplace in the average home.28 Because of this, it has been found that inside our homes, the air is 2 to 5 times more polluted than outdoor air due to the chemicals found in everyday and ordinary household products.29 Additionally, when looking at the increased prevalence of certain diseases known to be caused by chemical exposure, there is a positive correlation between the increase of chemical production in the US and disease prevalence, which furthers the evidence that toxic chemicals are now commonplace in American homes.30 Q: What is the history of this problem in the United States? A:  World War II brought about an increase in chemical usage—many of these chemicals were unregulated—in everyday consumer products.31 The chemical industry was largely self-regulating until the 1960s when the modern environmental movement was born.32 Due to pressure from growing environmental groups, President Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an independent agency of the US government in charge of environmental protection, with the top priority being regulation of chemical manufacturers.33 The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was then established in 1976, providing the EPA with the authority to require “reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to chemical substances and/or mixtures.” Some products, however, are generally excluded from TSCA, including food, drugs, cosmetics, and pesticides.34 Unfortunately, this act continued to protect the chemical industry by allowing them to use toxic chemicals by grandfathering in over 80,000 chemicals, making them very difficult to regulate.35 The TSCA was updated in 2016 by President Obama. This amendment updated the requirements for the testing of existing chemicals and increased transparency with the public about chemical information.36 Unfortunately, the EPA has yet to make substantial progress regarding the reform and has “taken every opportunity to undermine, not enhance, chemical safety.”37 However, the Trump administration reversed much of the progress that was made, delaying the strong enforcement of policies that Congress had been hoping for.38 Q: How does the United States compare with other countries in regards to toxic chemicals in consumer products? A: Due to the limited available data, it is impossible to know if more products in the US contain toxic chemicals or higher concentrations of toxic chemicals in comparison to other countries. Research does demonstrate, however, that the biggest difference between the United States and other comparable countries is the regulatory processes being used. The TSCA under the EPA is responsible for regulating chemicals in the United States. Likewise, the European Union (EU) also has processes in place for the regulation of harmful chemicals known as Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH). Unlike the EPA, REACH requires companies to study and ensure the safety of the chemicals they use before developing their products.39 REACH employs the precautionary principle that requires companies to prove a chemical is safe before using it in products. In the United States, the TSCA approaches the problem through an “innocent until proven guilty” lens, allowing for many harmful chemicals to circulate in commerce until there is undeniable evidence that the chemical is, in fact, harmful. Additionally, the burden for chemical testing is placed on the EPA rather than the chemical companies themselves. As such, the US approves many more products as safe compared to most other countries. For example, the EU has banned 1,328 chemicals that are “known or suspected to cause cancer, genetic mutation, reproductive harm or birth defects” in cosmetic products.40 The US has only banned or restricted 11.41 With the current system in place in the US, chemicals are not being tested to ensure they are safe, allowing for increased exposure to toxic chemicals. It is easy for many consumers to believe that someone is making sure that the products found on the shelf are safe.42 Consumers often assume that if a product is dangerous, toxic, or carcinogenic, it wouldn't be allowed to be sold.43 Some chemicals are even known to be toxic but are still allowed on the shelf, while others have not yet been evaluated for their health and safety.44 The EPA gets its authority and protocol to regulate chemicals from the passing of the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act. Under this act, the EPA has the authority to control any chemicals that “pose an unreasonable risk to human health or to the environment.”45 Unfortunately, it has now become clear that TSCA did not give the EPA all of the tools that it needs to do so properly or effectively. In fact, the passing of TSCA actually ended up protecting the chemical manufacturers more than the consumers. TSCA also granted the chemical industry and product manufacturers alike the benefit of secrecy by allowing them to keep the identity of some chemicals a secret from the public. As a result, “the EPA estimates that there are 17,000 secret chemicals in commerce today.”46 When it comes to cosmetics and fragrances, the FDA is the regulatory body in the US. Unfortunately, the FDA also is unable to regulate products because the guidelines haven't changed since being enacted in 1938.47 When dealing with fragrances, “fragrance and flavor ingredients do not need to be listed individually on cosmetic labels, because they are the ingredients most likely to be ‘trade secrets.’ Instead, they may be listed simply as ‘fragrance’ or ‘flavor.’”48 Additionally, the FDA “recommends” that manufacturers voluntarily register their scent with the agency, disclosing the ingredients used to make the fragrance. However, manufacturers rarely opt to do this because if anything bad happened to a consumer using their product, they could prove that the product was the culprit. The chemical industry fights transparency to avoid liability claims that could arise if any harm comes to a consumer because of the product.49 When taking all of this into account, it becomes clear that exposure to toxic chemicals has become nearly unavoidable in the United States because of the lack of testing and regulation in place.  Not only is it difficult to know which products to use because of a lack of transparency from manufacturers, but also consumers hoping to avoid these products are being misled through greenwashing practices.  The first way companies exploit the lack of knowledge of consumers is through the fragrance loophole. Almost all consumer products in the average American home contain the ingredient “fragrance.” Though it appears to be a singular ingredient, it's simply used in lieu of disclosing a combination of ingredients, and that one “ingredient” can actually be a mixture of hundreds of different hidden chemicals.50 This is due to the fact that companies can claim their “fragrance” as a government protected “trade secret.”51 This isn’t just limited to perfumes and scents—many industries claim that various ingredients in their products are trade secrets so that they can be exempt from having to disclose the toxic chemicals being used.52 There is no data showing the number of products that actually use the fragrance loophole, but when looking through products found at an average grocery or drug store, more often than not, they contain the ingredient “fragrance.” Many products marked as “unscented” still contain the ingredient of “fragrance,” and according to the EWG, around 3,163 ingredients are encapsulated in the fragrance category.53 The second way companies exploit the lack of knowledge of consumers is through greenwashing. Greenwashing is a marketing tactic that occurs when companies put labels like “non-toxic,” “green,” “natural,” and “eco-friendly” on their packaging to make the customer believe the product is good for them or the environment. In other words, greenwashing makes consumers believe the company is doing more to protect the environment than it really is; this process is often intentionally carried out through a wide range of marketing and PR efforts.54, 55 Many consumers are misled when reading the eco-friendly claims on a bottle and pay premium prices for a product that claims to be “green” or “non-toxic” when in reality, the product is often just as harmful as a non-greenwashed product. The fragrance loophole and greenwashing allow for companies to mask the potential harm of their products and prevent customers from making informed decisions about what products are safe to buy. Many companies in the US include toxic chemicals in their products because they are more cost efficient and because they can increase the efficacy of the product. As mentioned previously, the chemical restrictions in the EU are much stricter and more comprehensive than those used in the US. However, many products from large US brands are sold in Europe. Because of the stricter chemical regulation, US companies such as Pepsi, Quaker, Kellog’s, and Kraft-Heinz have actually created safer formulas to use in Europe but continue to use the less-safe formulas in the US because it is more cost effective.56, 57 Motivations surrounding cost efficiency and product effectiveness are also seen in fragrance manufacturing. The ingredients used in creating a fragrance come from either petroleum-derived materials (meaning manufactured or chemically-derived) or plant-derived materials.58 Many companies tend to use petroleum-derived ingredients as they are far cheaper.59 Many manufacturers that choose to use the pricier plant-derived scents directly list their ingredients on the bottle to be more transparent, whereas companies that use petroleum-derived scents and fragrances tend to contain questionable chemicals that need to be hidden from consumers through the fragrance loophole. We can see from this that there is a direct connection between the lack of transparency, the economics, and the profits of many of these companies.60 Additionally, chemically-derived fragrances can also contribute to the effectiveness of a product. In the case of perfumes, the concentration and lasting length is incredibly important and contains a specific combination of chemicals to achieve the desired result. These desired results aren’t always possible simply by using naturally-occurring scents without the help of chemicals.  Another example of the use of toxins for the sake of product efficiency is the infamous case of Teflon. DuPont, a prominent US chemical company, used the chemical Teflon to create an incredibly strong, nonreactive, and nonstick coating on cookware. DuPont began manufacturing Teflon in 1945 and it quickly became a major success. Teflon was an incredibly useful and effective product; in addition to pans, Teflon was also used to make “wire and cable coatings, fabric and carpet protectors, and waterproof fabrics.”61 Unfortunately, the main ingredient in Teflon was perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a chemical that belongs to the PFAS group. This chemical was known by DuPont to have severe impacts on human health but as it was not regulated by the government, DuPont continued to manufacture products with the chemical. It wasn’t until a major lawsuit against DuPont uncovered the truth about Teflon that the process of regulation began. Though PFOA is no longer allowed to be manufactured in the United States, it can still be imported and sold in products. Though much has been done to regulate and reduce PFOA and PFAS exposure, it is still found almost everywhere and continues to impact the health of people, animals, and the environment.62 One of the most important consequences is the negative health effects that can result from exposure to toxic chemicals. The health consequences associated with the exposure to these chemicals are very complex because the full extent of exposure is still largely unknown. As mentioned previously, of the 84,000 chemicals on the market in the US, only 1% have been tested for safety.63 Many of the proven health hazards are from the chemicals that have been tested, meaning the public is most likely exposed to a much larger amount of toxic chemicals, and their negative health effects, than researchers even know about.  The different ways a person can come into contact with hazardous chemicals are called exposure pathways. There are three basic exposure pathways: inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact.64 For example, inhalation of toxic chemicals can occur when chemicals get into the air we breathe as chemical pollutants build up in the indoor air when they are released from things like building products, foam furnishings, carpet, paint, personal care products, and cleaning products.65 Because of this, the EWG estimates that “the air inside our homes is 2 to 5 times more polluted than the air outside.”66 A common toxin found in indoor air is asbestos, which is found in a variety of construction materials and is also used as a fire retardant.67 Exposure to asbestos has been linked to lung disease, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.68 Ingestion of toxic chemicals can occur when chemicals get into the food we eat if our food has come in contact with the chemical.69 This can be through the watering of crops with contaminated water, the spraying of pesticides that contain toxic chemicals, or the ingestion of contaminated water or plants by fish or other animals that end up being eaten.70 A common toxin found in food is glyphosate, a pesticide that has been deemed by the World Health Organization as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”71 Chemicals can also end up in the water we drink when chemicals are inadequately disposed of and leak into drinking water sources, as discussed in the example of Teflon. Lastly, chemicals can enter the body through skin contact when putting on personal care products. Toxins enter the body through skin contact because skin, the largest organ of the body, absorbs nearly 64% of what gets put on it.72 A common toxin found in personal care products is formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen. The EWG estimates that “nearly 1 in 5 cosmetic products contains a substance that generates formaldehyde.”73  Different toxic chemicals affect the body in many different ways; some act as allergens while others are carcinogens, and others are linked to developmental and reproductive toxicity.74 Additionally, as mentioned previously, there are different groups of chemicals that are classified based on their effects on human health. For example, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) impact the endocrine system and tamper with hormones, creating a wide array of health consequences such as “alterations in sperm quality and fertility, abnormalities in sex organs, endometriosis, early puberty, altered nervous system function, immune function, certain cancers, respiratory problems, metabolic issues, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular problems, growth, neurological and learning disabilities, and more.”75 Additionally, endocrine disruptors are proven mutagens, meaning they can mutate DNA, possibly leading to harm to cells and the development of certain cancers.76 There is also the PFAS group that consists of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances known as “forever chemicals” that never break down in nature nor within the human body and cause their own adverse health effects.77 For example, in the Teflon example, countless residents of Parkersburg and the surrounding areas had been dying of rare cancers, suffering birth defects, developing blackened teeth, and so much more for decades following the dumping of PFOA into the river.78 A scientific study was conducted to determine if there was a link between PFOA and any of these diseases.79 Nearly 70,000 West Virginians received a blood test and a medical examination for this study, and the scientists concluded that “there was a ‘probable link’ between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia, and ulcerative colitis.”80 The health effects that come from exposure to these toxic chemicals occur over time as the different chemicals and health effects accumulate. One of the most common health issues linked to toxic chemicals is cancer. The risk of breast cancer has increased from 1 in 20 in the 1960s to 1 in 8 today; this increase has been partially attributed to the increase in use of toxic chemicals in consumer products.81 In 2009, professionals suggested that the risk of cancer due to toxic chemicals was greatly underestimated.82  Another health issue linked to toxic chemicals is reproductive issues. Chemical exposure not only affects the mother, but can also contaminate babies while still in the womb. Everyday items like Teflon, Scotchgard, flame retardants, fragrances, and the byproducts of burning gasoline and garbage all end up in women’s bodies through ingestion or inhalation, which can then enter babies’ bodies even before birth.83 For example, the Environmental Working Group tested the umbilical cord blood from 10 babies born in the US. Of the more than 300 chemicals they tested for, they found 287 chemicals altogether.84 In the case of PFAS or the “forever chemicals,” these chemicals never break down and continue to accumulate.85 According to the Environmental Working Group, almost all Americans have PFAS in their blood, which includes newborn babies. They estimate that 110 million people in the US could be drinking water that is contaminated with PFAS.86 Though it is often hard to see the impact of these chemicals in the short term, longitudinal evidence indicates a very strong correlation between exposure to toxic chemicals and severe or even fatal health consequences.87  Toxic chemicals and the chemical industry as a whole are major contributors to environmental pollution. Environmental pollution, in turn, affects human health as well as environmental health, creating a cycle between the two. Of specific note, toxins from consumer products affect animals, plants, and water pollution, increasing the likelihood of environmental illness for the human population if they eat meat from animals, eat produce, or ingest water that has been contaminated. For example, in the case of Teflon, over 7,100 tons of PFOA-laced sludge was dumped into unlined pits on the DuPont plant property that seeped into the local water table. This ended up affecting not only human health, but the health of animals within the Parkersburg area as well. There were 153 cows belonging to a farmer in Parkersburg that were completely healthy, but ended up dying. They showed symptoms such as blackened teeth, discolored organs, stringy tails, malformed hooves, constant diarrhea, receded eyes, and eyes the color of chemical blue.88  Foam laced with PFOA chemicals washing ashore. Water polluted by toxins can also be harmful to marine life. Synthetic pesticides used for weed and bug control are toxic to marine life even in small amounts.89 These pollutants affect the life and health of marine life; for example, when a fish is exposed to heavy metals, it can affect the fish’s sense of smell, which makes it difficult for the fish to find food and avoid predators.90 These pollutants enter water sources containing marine life most commonly through storm drains and household drains.91  Harmful algal bloom. Another major problem caused by environmental pollutants is harmful algal blooms. Harmful algal blooms typically occur due to a nutrient such as nitrogen or phosphorus entering in the water and causing an excessive growth of algae.92 The primary sources of excess nitrogen and phosphorus, causing these harmful algal blooms, are agricultural products (such as animal manure and chemical fertilizers), stormwater, wastewater, fossil fuels, and certain products like soap and detergents found in the home.93 Harmful algal blooms can create very harmful toxins that can make people and animals sick, and even kill them. These algal blooms can create dead zones in bodies of water, which raises treatment costs for drinking water and make it more difficult and costly for industries that need clean water.94 Though quantitative evidence demonstrating the extent to which toxic chemicals in consumer products affect the environment across the United States is sparse, studies do show that these detrimental effects on environmental health are severe and widespread and can be traced back to toxic chemicals in consumer products. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) is a “non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.”95 The EWG has a team of scientists, policy experts, lawyers, communications experts, and programmers that work to stand up for public health when the government and industry will not. The EWG also creates reports, online databases, mobile apps, and communications campaigns to help consumers make safer and more informed decisions about their products and the companies they support. The EWG researches the chemicals the government and chemical industry will not disclose and publicizes their findings. They also launched a program called EWG VERIFIED that works with companies to verify their product as clean and nontoxic. This verification covers personal care, cleaning, and baby products. This is incredibly impactful as their efforts are reaching large corporations like Procter & Gamble to release products that are clean and transparent. They also have an app that allows users to search their products and determine if it is clean or not. It also breaks down the ingredients in the product and shows the user if and why they are harmful. The key issues the EWG focuses on are consumer products, cosmetics, energy, farming, food, water, PFAS chemicals, toxics, and children’s health. They have also created and published several reports to help guide and educate consumers to safer and healthier choices.  In 2019, the EWG came to a turning point in their efforts. Due to demand from consumers, many big-name companies like Procter & Gamble turned to the EWG for guidance and expertise in an effort to self-regulate some of the chemicals in their products to ensure the chemicals being used in them are safe.96 Because of this, EWG VERIFIED now works directly with the companies to create verified safe products.97 While they do not have any impact measurements, their reported outputs in 2019 were that the EWG gathered 1.3 million petition signatures and letters to Congress supporting the reform of regulation.98 Their websites were visited more than 21 million times by 13 million people and they earned approximately $59.5 million worth of free media exposure.99  The EWG does a great job of measuring the outputs of their initiatives. However, their outcome and impact measurements are lacking. Though the EWG is responsible for countless reports and research done on chemicals as well as several programs and initiatives intended to inform, it is difficult to understand the true scale of their impact. The EWG should focus on collecting better impact measurements to better understand the change they are responsible for. Additionally, the EWG is simply an activist group that conducts their own research on the issue. Because of this, all they can really do is inform and advocate. They don’t have the authority to enforce any rules or regulations regarding their findings. Even when they discover that a certain chemical is harmful, they can’t force companies to stop using the chemical, they can only advocate to have the government ban it.

                    By Cadee Wambolt Published Winter 2021 Special thanks to Sam Lofgran for editing and research contributions Many of the consumer products sold in the United States contain toxic chemicals. This is due to a lack of testing and regulation, lack of knowledge of consumers, government-protected trade secrets, marketing and PR tactics, and a desire for cost efficiency and product effectiveness. Because of this, many Americans are frequently and unknowingly exposed to toxic chemicals that have been shown to cause various health issues such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, birth defects, infertility, and hormone imbalances, among other issues. These toxic chemicals have also been shown to contribute to environmental issues. One of the leading organizations combating this issue is the Environmental Working Group, which focuses on research and advocacy surrounding agriculture, water pollution, toxic chemicals, and corporate accountability. Carcinogen — “A substance or agent causing cancer.”1 Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC) — “Substances in our environment, food, and consumer products that interfere with hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, or action resulting in a deviation from normal homeostatic control or reproduction.”2 Endocrine System — “The glands and organs that make hormones and release them directly into the blood so they can travel to tissues and organs all over the body. The hormones released by the endocrine system control many important functions in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, and reproduction.”3 Grandfathering — A common business term meaning “to allow someone to do or to have something that a new law or rule makes illegal,” similar to “exempt” or “excuse.”4 Although this term has a problematic history due to its tie to slavery,5 the term will be used throughout this brief since it is the term that continues to be used in modern business practices. Greenwashing — A marketing tactic where companies put labels such as “non-toxic,” “green,” “natural,” and “eco-friendly” on their packaging to make the customer believe the product is good for the environment.6  Mutagen — “A chemical or physical agent that has the ability to change our genetic code in a harmful way . . . our body has the ability to recognize and repair these mutations.” If they escape repair they can develop into a tumor cell, therefore aiding in the development of cancer.7 PFAS — “Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that includes PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other chemicals. PFAS have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries around the globe, including in the United States since the 1940s. PFOA and PFOS have been the most extensively produced and studied of these chemicals. Both chemicals are very persistent in the environment and in the human body – meaning they don’t break down and they can accumulate over time. There is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse human health effects.” PFAS can be found in food, commercial household products, workplace environments, drinking water, and living organisms.8 Precautionary Principle — “The precautionary principle, proposed as a new guideline in environmental decision making, has four central components: taking preventive action in the face of uncertainty; shifting the burden of proof to the proponents of an activity; exploring a wide range of alternatives to possibly harmful actions; and increasing public participation in decision making.”9  Toxic — “Containing or being poisonous material especially when capable of causing death or serious debilitation.”10 Trade Secret — &quot;Information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.”11 Q: What are toxic chemicals? A: Toxic chemicals are any substance that is harmful to the environment or human health “if inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin.” 12  Q: Why are toxic chemicals in consumer products a social issue? A: Toxins found in everyday consumer products are known to be a cause of many health issues. Due to the prevalence of toxins in many manufactured products, virtually all populations are exposed and at risk for these negative health effects. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) warns that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), a common toxin found in consumer products, represents a global health threat because they can cause diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.13 Q: Who is most affected by toxic chemicals in consumer products? A: Although toxins are a health threat for most populations, there is a known disparity in EDC exposure for people with a lower socioeconomic status (SES). Numerous studies have found that African Americans, Latinos, and low income individuals face greater exposure to diabetogenic EDCs, which may contribute to these groups having higher levels of diabetes.14 While the research has not reached a consensus as to why these disparities exist, it is possibly due to the higher expense of fresh food, and thus the higher consumption of processed foods by those of low SES; processed food often comes in packaging that increases BPA exposure.15 Though people of lower SES may have more exposure to toxic chemicals, it is still a threat to the entire population. Additionally, as most non-toxic products tend to come at premium prices, it is easier for people of higher SES to avoid these toxins by purchasing the more expensive products. Unfortunately, people of lower SES may not have that luxury as they may not have the ability or means to do so, even if they wanted to.16 This brief will focus on general exposure to toxins for most populations in the US with the general understanding that those in lower socioeconomic spheres will be more affected by each of these contributing factors and consequences than those with higher SES. Q: What are consumer products? A: “Consumer products, also referred to as final goods, are products that are bought by individuals or households for personal use. In other words, consumer products are goods that are bought for consumption by the average consumer.”17 There are four categories of consumer products: convenience products, shopping products, specialty products, and unsought products.18 See graphic for examples of these types of products. Q: What kinds of toxic chemicals are often found in consumer products? A:  Currently, there are 5 groups of chemicals that are of main concern to consumers: pesticides, phthalates, flame retardants, bisphenol (BPA), and PFAS.19 Unfortunately these chemicals are commonly found almost everywhere including, but not limited to, canned food and receipt paper containing BPA, cosmetics as they have no required safety testing and no monitoring of labeling or health effects, pesticides found on food even after washing, vinyl plastic and phthalates used in building materials, schools, hospitals, and consumer products, and flame retardants used in furniture, cars, electronics, and baby products.20 Additionally, endocrine disrupting chemicals represent a broad set of chemicals known to affect the endocrine system. EDCs are man-made chemicals; some common examples include flame retardants (BFRs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates, BPA, lead, cadmium, many pesticides and herbicides, DDT, atrazine, and PFAS.21, 22 These endocrine disruptors interfere with the function of the hormones by binding to the same sites and cells where the hormones normally bind and interfering with the normal processing. This becomes especially problematic as a disruption to hormones can cause many adverse health effects.23 Q: How many toxins are found in consumer products in the United States today? A: It is impossible to know the exact number or concentration of toxins in 
consumer products in circulation today. This, in part, is due to the fact that a lack of testing and regulation has allowed many toxic chemicals to go untested and unnoticed. Therefore, though there are many toxins still being used that have been proven to be unsafe, researchers postulate that there are many more toxic chemicals in consumer products than they know about due to a lack of testing.  There are some statistics, however, that demonstrate how widespread toxin use is in consumer products. For example, an evaluation of products at dollar stores in the US revealed that 38% of products contained the toxic plastic PVC, and 32% of these products exceeded phthalate limits established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.24 Additionally, 81% of dollar store products contained at least one hazardous chemical above the established level of concern.25 This not only indicates the widespread use of toxic chemicals in consumer products, but leads to disproportionate exposure for people of lower SES as they are more likely to purchase dollar store products due to financial limitations. Additionally, it has been revealed that most of the 80,000 chemicals currently in circulation in consumer products in the United States have not been adequately tested for safety or for their effects on human health.26 In fact, only about 1% have been studied.27 Though it is unknown how many products on the shelf contain toxic chemicals or how many toxic chemicals are in circulation, studies reveal that it is safe to assume that toxic chemicals are now commonplace in the average home.28 Because of this, it has been found that inside our homes, the air is 2 to 5 times more polluted than outdoor air due to the chemicals found in everyday and ordinary household products.29 Additionally, when looking at the increased prevalence of certain diseases known to be caused by chemical exposure, there is a positive correlation between the increase of chemical production in the US and disease prevalence, which furthers the evidence that toxic chemicals are now commonplace in American homes.30 Q: What is the history of this problem in the United States? A:  World War II brought about an increase in chemical usage—many of these chemicals were unregulated—in everyday consumer products.31 The chemical industry was largely self-regulating until the 1960s when the modern environmental movement was born.32 Due to pressure from growing environmental groups, President Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an independent agency of the US government in charge of environmental protection, with the top priority being regulation of chemical manufacturers.33 The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was then established in 1976, providing the EPA with the authority to require “reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to chemical substances and/or mixtures.” Some products, however, are generally excluded from TSCA, including food, drugs, cosmetics, and pesticides.34 Unfortunately, this act continued to protect the chemical industry by allowing them to use toxic chemicals by grandfathering in over 80,000 chemicals, making them very difficult to regulate.35 The TSCA was updated in 2016 by President Obama. This amendment updated the requirements for the testing of existing chemicals and increased transparency with the public about chemical information.36 Unfortunately, the EPA has yet to make substantial progress regarding the reform and has “taken every opportunity to undermine, not enhance, chemical safety.”37 However, the Trump administration reversed much of the progress that was made, delaying the strong enforcement of policies that Congress had been hoping for.38 Q: How does the United States compare with other countries in regards to toxic chemicals in consumer products? A: Due to the limited available data, it is impossible to know if more products in the US contain toxic chemicals or higher concentrations of toxic chemicals in comparison to other countries. Research does demonstrate, however, that the biggest difference between the United States and other comparable countries is the regulatory processes being used. The TSCA under the EPA is responsible for regulating chemicals in the United States. Likewise, the European Union (EU) also has processes in place for the regulation of harmful chemicals known as Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH). Unlike the EPA, REACH requires companies to study and ensure the safety of the chemicals they use before developing their products.39 REACH employs the precautionary principle that requires companies to prove a chemical is safe before using it in products. In the United States, the TSCA approaches the problem through an “innocent until proven guilty” lens, allowing for many harmful chemicals to circulate in commerce until there is undeniable evidence that the chemical is, in fact, harmful. Additionally, the burden for chemical testing is placed on the EPA rather than the chemical companies themselves. As such, the US approves many more products as safe compared to most other countries. For example, the EU has banned 1,328 chemicals that are “known or suspected to cause cancer, genetic mutation, reproductive harm or birth defects” in cosmetic products.40 The US has only banned or restricted 11.41 With the current system in place in the US, chemicals are not being tested to ensure they are safe, allowing for increased exposure to toxic chemicals. It is easy for many consumers to believe that someone is making sure that the products found on the shelf are safe.42 Consumers often assume that if a product is dangerous, toxic, or carcinogenic, it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be sold.43 Some chemicals are even known to be toxic but are still allowed on the shelf, while others have not yet been evaluated for their health and safety.44 The EPA gets its authority and protocol to regulate chemicals from the passing of the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act. Under this act, the EPA has the authority to control any chemicals that “pose an unreasonable risk to human health or to the environment.”45 Unfortunately, it has now become clear that TSCA did not give the EPA all of the tools that it needs to do so properly or effectively. In fact, the passing of TSCA actually ended up protecting the chemical manufacturers more than the consumers. TSCA also granted the chemical industry and product manufacturers alike the benefit of secrecy by allowing them to keep the identity of some chemicals a secret from the public. As a result, “the EPA estimates that there are 17,000 secret chemicals in commerce today.”46 When it comes to cosmetics and fragrances, the FDA is the regulatory body in the US. Unfortunately, the FDA also is unable to regulate products because the guidelines haven&#x27;t changed since being enacted in 1938.47 When dealing with fragrances, “fragrance and flavor ingredients do not need to be listed individually on cosmetic labels, because they are the ingredients most likely to be ‘trade secrets.’ Instead, they may be listed simply as ‘fragrance’ or ‘flavor.’”48 Additionally, the FDA “recommends” that manufacturers voluntarily register their scent with the agency, disclosing the ingredients used to make the fragrance. However, manufacturers rarely opt to do this because if anything bad happened to a consumer using their product, they could prove that the product was the culprit. The chemical industry fights transparency to avoid liability claims that could arise if any harm comes to a consumer because of the product.49 When taking all of this into account, it becomes clear that exposure to toxic chemicals has become nearly unavoidable in the United States because of the lack of testing and regulation in place.  Not only is it difficult to know which products to use because of a lack of transparency from manufacturers, but also consumers hoping to avoid these products are being misled through greenwashing practices.  The first way companies exploit the lack of knowledge of consumers is through the fragrance loophole. Almost all consumer products in the average American home contain the ingredient “fragrance.” Though it appears to be a singular ingredient, it&#x27;s simply used in lieu of disclosing a combination of ingredients, and that one “ingredient” can actually be a mixture of hundreds of different hidden chemicals.50 This is due to the fact that companies can claim their “fragrance” as a government protected “trade secret.”51 This isn’t just limited to perfumes and scents—many industries claim that various ingredients in their products are trade secrets so that they can be exempt from having to disclose the toxic chemicals being used.52 There is no data showing the number of products that actually use the fragrance loophole, but when looking through products found at an average grocery or drug store, more often than not, they contain the ingredient “fragrance.” Many products marked as “unscented” still contain the ingredient of “fragrance,” and according to the EWG, around 3,163 ingredients are encapsulated in the fragrance category.53 The second way companies exploit the lack of knowledge of consumers is through greenwashing. Greenwashing is a marketing tactic that occurs when companies put labels like “non-toxic,” “green,” “natural,” and “eco-friendly” on their packaging to make the customer believe the product is good for them or the environment. In other words, greenwashing makes consumers believe the company is doing more to protect the environment than it really is; this process is often intentionally carried out through a wide range of marketing and PR efforts.54, 55 Many consumers are misled when reading the eco-friendly claims on a bottle and pay premium prices for a product that claims to be “green” or “non-toxic” when in reality, the product is often just as harmful as a non-greenwashed product. The fragrance loophole and greenwashing allow for companies to mask the potential harm of their products and prevent customers from making informed decisions about what products are safe to buy. Many companies in the US include toxic chemicals in their products because they are more cost efficient and because they can increase the efficacy of the product. As mentioned previously, the chemical restrictions in the EU are much stricter and more comprehensive than those used in the US. However, many products from large US brands are sold in Europe. Because of the stricter chemical regulation, US companies such as Pepsi, Quaker, Kellog’s, and Kraft-Heinz have actually created safer formulas to use in Europe but continue to use the less-safe formulas in the US because it is more cost effective.56, 57 Motivations surrounding cost efficiency and product effectiveness are also seen in fragrance manufacturing. The ingredients used in creating a fragrance come from either petroleum-derived materials (meaning manufactured or chemically-derived) or plant-derived materials.58 Many companies tend to use petroleum-derived ingredients as they are far cheaper.59 Many manufacturers that choose to use the pricier plant-derived scents directly list their ingredients on the bottle to be more transparent, whereas companies that use petroleum-derived scents and fragrances tend to contain questionable chemicals that need to be hidden from consumers through the fragrance loophole. We can see from this that there is a direct connection between the lack of transparency, the economics, and the profits of many of these companies.60 Additionally, chemically-derived fragrances can also contribute to the effectiveness of a product. In the case of perfumes, the concentration and lasting length is incredibly important and contains a specific combination of chemicals to achieve the desired result. These desired results aren’t always possible simply by using naturally-occurring scents without the help of chemicals.  Another example of the use of toxins for the sake of product efficiency is the infamous case of Teflon. DuPont, a prominent US chemical company, used the chemical Teflon to create an incredibly strong, nonreactive, and nonstick coating on cookware. DuPont began manufacturing Teflon in 1945 and it quickly became a major success. Teflon was an incredibly useful and effective product; in addition to pans, Teflon was also used to make “wire and cable coatings, fabric and carpet protectors, and waterproof fabrics.”61 Unfortunately, the main ingredient in Teflon was perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a chemical that belongs to the PFAS group. This chemical was known by DuPont to have severe impacts on human health but as it was not regulated by the government, DuPont continued to manufacture products with the chemical. It wasn’t until a major lawsuit against DuPont uncovered the truth about Teflon that the process of regulation began. Though PFOA is no longer allowed to be manufactured in the United States, it can still be imported and sold in products. Though much has been done to regulate and reduce PFOA and PFAS exposure, it is still found almost everywhere and continues to impact the health of people, animals, and the environment.62 One of the most important consequences is the negative health effects that can result from exposure to toxic chemicals. The health consequences associated with the exposure to these chemicals are very complex because the full extent of exposure is still largely unknown. As mentioned previously, of the 84,000 chemicals on the market in the US, only 1% have been tested for safety.63 Many of the proven health hazards are from the chemicals that have been tested, meaning the public is most likely exposed to a much larger amount of toxic chemicals, and their negative health effects, than researchers even know about.  The different ways a person can come into contact with hazardous chemicals are called exposure pathways. There are three basic exposure pathways: inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact.64 For example, inhalation of toxic chemicals can occur when chemicals get into the air we breathe as chemical pollutants build up in the indoor air when they are released from things like building products, foam furnishings, carpet, paint, personal care products, and cleaning products.65 Because of this, the EWG estimates that “the air inside our homes is 2 to 5 times more polluted than the air outside.”66 A common toxin found in indoor air is asbestos, which is found in a variety of construction materials and is also used as a fire retardant.67 Exposure to asbestos has been linked to lung disease, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.68 Ingestion of toxic chemicals can occur when chemicals get into the food we eat if our food has come in contact with the chemical.69 This can be through the watering of crops with contaminated water, the spraying of pesticides that contain toxic chemicals, or the ingestion of contaminated water or plants by fish or other animals that end up being eaten.70 A common toxin found in food is glyphosate, a pesticide that has been deemed by the World Health Organization as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”71 Chemicals can also end up in the water we drink when chemicals are inadequately disposed of and leak into drinking water sources, as discussed in the example of Teflon. Lastly, chemicals can enter the body through skin contact when putting on personal care products. Toxins enter the body through skin contact because skin, the largest organ of the body, absorbs nearly 64% of what gets put on it.72 A common toxin found in personal care products is formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen. The EWG estimates that “nearly 1 in 5 cosmetic products contains a substance that generates formaldehyde.”73  Different toxic chemicals affect the body in many different ways; some act as allergens while others are carcinogens, and others are linked to developmental and reproductive toxicity.74 Additionally, as mentioned previously, there are different groups of chemicals that are classified based on their effects on human health. For example, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) impact the endocrine system and tamper with hormones, creating a wide array of health consequences such as “alterations in sperm quality and fertility, abnormalities in sex organs, endometriosis, early puberty, altered nervous system function, immune function, certain cancers, respiratory problems, metabolic issues, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular problems, growth, neurological and learning disabilities, and more.”75 Additionally, endocrine disruptors are proven mutagens, meaning they can mutate DNA, possibly leading to harm to cells and the development of certain cancers.76 There is also the PFAS group that consists of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances known as “forever chemicals” that never break down in nature nor within the human body and cause their own adverse health effects.77 For example, in the Teflon example, countless residents of Parkersburg and the surrounding areas had been dying of rare cancers, suffering birth defects, developing blackened teeth, and so much more for decades following the dumping of PFOA into the river.78 A scientific study was conducted to determine if there was a link between PFOA and any of these diseases.79 Nearly 70,000 West Virginians received a blood test and a medical examination for this study, and the scientists concluded that “there was a ‘probable link’ between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia, and ulcerative colitis.”80 The health effects that come from exposure to these toxic chemicals occur over time as the different chemicals and health effects accumulate. One of the most common health issues linked to toxic chemicals is cancer. The risk of breast cancer has increased from 1 in 20 in the 1960s to 1 in 8 today; this increase has been partially attributed to the increase in use of toxic chemicals in consumer products.81 In 2009, professionals suggested that the risk of cancer due to toxic chemicals was greatly underestimated.82  Another health issue linked to toxic chemicals is reproductive issues. Chemical exposure not only affects the mother, but can also contaminate babies while still in the womb. Everyday items like Teflon, Scotchgard, flame retardants, fragrances, and the byproducts of burning gasoline and garbage all end up in women’s bodies through ingestion or inhalation, which can then enter babies’ bodies even before birth.83 For example, the Environmental Working Group tested the umbilical cord blood from 10 babies born in the US. Of the more than 300 chemicals they tested for, they found 287 chemicals altogether.84 In the case of PFAS or the “forever chemicals,” these chemicals never break down and continue to accumulate.85 According to the Environmental Working Group, almost all Americans have PFAS in their blood, which includes newborn babies. They estimate that 110 million people in the US could be drinking water that is contaminated with PFAS.86 Though it is often hard to see the impact of these chemicals in the short term, longitudinal evidence indicates a very strong correlation between exposure to toxic chemicals and severe or even fatal health consequences.87  Toxic chemicals and the chemical industry as a whole are major contributors to environmental pollution. Environmental pollution, in turn, affects human health as well as environmental health, creating a cycle between the two. Of specific note, toxins from consumer products affect animals, plants, and water pollution, increasing the likelihood of environmental illness for the human population if they eat meat from animals, eat produce, or ingest water that has been contaminated. For example, in the case of Teflon, over 7,100 tons of PFOA-laced sludge was dumped into unlined pits on the DuPont plant property that seeped into the local water table. This ended up affecting not only human health, but the health of animals within the Parkersburg area as well. There were 153 cows belonging to a farmer in Parkersburg that were completely healthy, but ended up dying. They showed symptoms such as blackened teeth, discolored organs, stringy tails, malformed hooves, constant diarrhea, receded eyes, and eyes the color of chemical blue.88  Foam laced with PFOA chemicals washing ashore. Water polluted by toxins can also be harmful to marine life. Synthetic pesticides used for weed and bug control are toxic to marine life even in small amounts.89 These pollutants affect the life and health of marine life; for example, when a fish is exposed to heavy metals, it can affect the fish’s sense of smell, which makes it difficult for the fish to find food and avoid predators.90 These pollutants enter water sources containing marine life most commonly through storm drains and household drains.91  Harmful algal bloom. Another major problem caused by environmental pollutants is harmful algal blooms. Harmful algal blooms typically occur due to a nutrient such as nitrogen or phosphorus entering in the water and causing an excessive growth of algae.92 The primary sources of excess nitrogen and phosphorus, causing these harmful algal blooms, are agricultural products (such as animal manure and chemical fertilizers), stormwater, wastewater, fossil fuels, and certain products like soap and detergents found in the home.93 Harmful algal blooms can create very harmful toxins that can make people and animals sick, and even kill them. These algal blooms can create dead zones in bodies of water, which raises treatment costs for drinking water and make it more difficult and costly for industries that need clean water.94 Though quantitative evidence demonstrating the extent to which toxic chemicals in consumer products affect the environment across the United States is sparse, studies do show that these detrimental effects on environmental health are severe and widespread and can be traced back to toxic chemicals in consumer products. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) is a “non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.”95 The EWG has a team of scientists, policy experts, lawyers, communications experts, and programmers that work to stand up for public health when the government and industry will not. The EWG also creates reports, online databases, mobile apps, and communications campaigns to help consumers make safer and more informed decisions about their products and the companies they support. The EWG researches the chemicals the government and chemical industry will not disclose and publicizes their findings. They also launched a program called EWG VERIFIED that works with companies to verify their product as clean and nontoxic. This verification covers personal care, cleaning, and baby products. This is incredibly impactful as their efforts are reaching large corporations like Procter &amp; Gamble to release products that are clean and transparent. They also have an app that allows users to search their products and determine if it is clean or not. It also breaks down the ingredients in the product and shows the user if and why they are harmful. The key issues the EWG focuses on are consumer products, cosmetics, energy, farming, food, water, PFAS chemicals, toxics, and children’s health. They have also created and published several reports to help guide and educate consumers to safer and healthier choices.  In 2019, the EWG came to a turning point in their efforts. Due to demand from consumers, many big-name companies like Procter &amp; Gamble turned to the EWG for guidance and expertise in an effort to self-regulate some of the chemicals in their products to ensure the chemicals being used in them are safe.96 Because of this, EWG VERIFIED now works directly with the companies to create verified safe products.97 While they do not have any impact measurements, their reported outputs in 2019 were that the EWG gathered 1.3 million petition signatures and letters to Congress supporting the reform of regulation.98 Their websites were visited more than 21 million times by 13 million people and they earned approximately $59.5 million worth of free media exposure.99  The EWG does a great job of measuring the outputs of their initiatives. However, their outcome and impact measurements are lacking. Though the EWG is responsible for countless reports and research done on chemicals as well as several programs and initiatives intended to inform, it is difficult to understand the true scale of their impact. The EWG should focus on collecting better impact measurements to better understand the change they are responsible for. Additionally, the EWG is simply an activist group that conducts their own research on the issue. Because of this, all they can really do is inform and advocate. They don’t have the authority to enforce any rules or regulations regarding their findings. Even when they discover that a certain chemical is harmful, they can’t force companies to stop using the chemical, they can only advocate to have the government ban it.
