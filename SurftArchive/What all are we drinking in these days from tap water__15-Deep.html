                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Almost half of the tap water in the US is contaminated with chemicals known as “forever chemicals,” according to a new study from the US Geological Survey.
   
      The number of people drinking contaminated water may be even higher than what the study found, however, because the researchers weren’t able to test for all of these per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, or PFAS, chemicals that are considered dangerous to human health. There are more than 12,000 types of PFAS, according to the National Institutes of Health, but this study looked at only 32 of the compounds.
   
How to reduce PFAS in your drinking water, according to experts
 
      PFAS are a family of ubiquitous synthetic chemicals that linger in the environment and the human body. PFAS exposure is linked to problems like cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone suppression, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
 
      In June 2022, based on the latest science, the EPA issued health advisories that said the chemicals are much more hazardous to human health than scientists originally thought and are probably more dangerous even at levels thousands of times lower than previously believed.
   
      Health effects from the chemicals can be difficult to specify in part because people may be exposed in different ways and at different stages of development and because there are so many types of PFAS chemicals with types and uses that have changed over time.
   
      Most people in the United States have been exposed to some PFAS, and some may be at higher risk, such as industrial workers involved in making PFAS and people who live near those facilities. There’s ongoing research to determine how different levels of exposure to PFAS chemicals might lead to various health effects.
   
      Experts say it’s important for people to understand their risk of exposure through tap water. Water filters may help somewhat if tap water is contaminated and there are moves to regulate some PFAS chemicals in US drinking water.
   
      Previously, there was limited information on exactly how much PFAS chemicals are in residential tap water, said the authors of the research, published Wednesday in the journal Environmental International. They added that this study is the most comprehensive to date that includes both private wells and public water sources.
   
      The scientists collected water samples directly from taps at 716 locations – 269 from private wells and 447 from public sources – between 2016 and 2021. Based on their findings, they estimate that at least one PFAS chemical would be detected in 45% of US drinking water samples.
   
      Most of the contamination came from water sources near urban areas and in areas that generated PFAS, like manufacturing that uses the chemicals in its products or sites where waste was collected.
   
      The highest concentrations of PFAS in drinking water were found in the Great Plains, the Great Lakes, the Eastern Seaboard and Central/Southern California, the study said.
   
EPA proposes first standards to make drinking water safer from ‘forever chemicals’
 
      Concentrations were similar between private wells and public supplies.
   
      PFAS can be found in many places, studies show, so toxicologist Dr. Jamie DeWitt is not surprised that it is in so much drinking water.
   
      “There’s been almost no place scientists have looked where they have not found PFAS,” said DeWitt, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology in the Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology at East Carolina University who was not involved in the new study.
   
      PFAS are found in hundreds of household items. The chemicals are used to make carpets and clothes stain-resistant. They keep food from sticking to pans and food packaging, and they’re good at keeping grease and water from soaking through. PFAS are in mobile phones, commercial airplanes and low-emission vehicles, in the foods you can buy at the farmers market or the grocery store, and in rainwater and dental floss. They’re even in the dust that collects in your home.
   
      A 2019 study suggested that PFAS chemicals could be found in 98% of the US population. With that in mind, the new 45% number may sound low, but DeWitt said there could be a couple factors at play. For one, a number of utilities have been making an effort to remove PFAS from the water. Homeowners could also have filters on their systems that make it so PFAS are not as easily detectable.
   
      “I think that’s still a pretty high number, considering,” she said.
   
      DeWitt said that it’s important for people to know what’s in their drinking water but that they don’t necessarily need to be scared.
   
      “I don’t think people should be afraid, but they should be aware and armed themselves with knowledge so that they can get information that will help them to make decisions,” she said.
   
Child growth and development hampered by PFAS in blood, study says
 
      She recommended looking at your local utility website to get its most recent water report. Utilities will disclose what’s in the water and what they are doing to reduce contaminants.
   
      A carbon filter can help, but it has to be changed regularly. If used too long, the filter can become saturated with chemicals and not work as well. Households can also use reverse osmosis filtering systems, but those can be expensive.
   
      The EPA has proposed the first national drinking water standards for six PFAS chemicals. The proposed limits set the allowable levels for these chemicals so low that they could not be easily detected.
   
      If the standards are finalized, water systems will have to determine whether levels of these PFAS pose a potential risk. They may also need to install treatment or take other actions, the EPA said, and may even need to switch to different water sources.
   
      If PFAS is in 45% of US water systems, the country will have a lot of work to do, said Dr. Graham Peaslee, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and concurrent professor of chemistry and biochemistry who does PFAS research at the University of Notre Dame.

      “I think that we should try our best to work on how to clean this up. My fear is that this is, global warming aside, this is probably the most expensive environmental problem we’re ever going to face,” said Peaslee, who was not involved in the new study. ”There’s nothing that will magically fix it. It’s fairly expensive to clean this up. And it’s a recurring cost, and there’s no permanent solutions to it for any particular utility. It looks frightening.”
   
      But the cleanup will have to be done, he said, because these chemicals carry real health consequences, and people can’t exactly avoid drinking water.
   
      “It’s really insidious, this poison,” Peaslee said. “We are going to have to get inventive on how to filter it out for all of our days.”

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: FREE U.S. SHIPPING - ORDERS $75+  Let’s talk about tap water. Many of us in the United States have easy access to tap water at home and in restaurants. But what exactly is in our tap water? Where does it come from and is it safe to drink? In this article, we explore everything you need to know about tap water, one of the most overlooked staples in your diet. Tap water in the United States comes primarily from three sources — lakes, rivers, and groundwater. The source of your tap water depends entirely on where you are located. With over 100,000 lakes and 250,000 rivers across the US, plus hundreds of reservoirs, there’s a lot of variance in water sources for Americans. Some cities, like Boston and San Francisco, get 100% of their drinking water from reservoirs, while other cities rely on rivers and lakes, or a combination of both. For example: Though it is rare, some water is supplied from newer sources like seawater in San Diego County. While the majority of the world’s water exists in the oceans, very few cities are converting saltwater into drinking water. Desalination (the process of converting seawater to drinking water) is cost prohibitive and the lack of technology makes it a challenging investment for most cities. The cost per gallon from a desalination plant can cost consumers up to 2.5x more per month. From the source, your water is sent to a treatment facility to be processed and sanitized before it is directed to your faucet. There are four steps in the treatment process: coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. The first step, coagulation and flocculation is a process in which chemicals are added to the water to clump small particles together. This process helps form larger particles that can be easily filtered out. The common reagents added during this process include aluminum salts, polymers, iron, activated carbons, talcum, and activated silica. When they bind together, this is called “floc.” The sedimentation process occurs next when the floc settles at the bottom of the tank. Once the floc has settled, water is then filtered to remove any fine particles of dust, parasites, microorganisms, bacteria, and chemicals.  Finally, the water is disinfected to ensure any remaining microbial contaminants are destroyed. To do so, chemicals such as chlorine, chlorinates, or chlorine dioxides are added to the water. Disinfecting the water with these chemicals is a quick way to prevent outbreaks of waterborne infections and parasitic diseases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This is also the stage where some cities add fluoride to prevent tooth decay — don’t worry, we’ll dive into that further. Tap water is relatively safe. However, some of the most common contaminants that remain in our tap water after treatment include aluminum, arsenic, copper, iron, lead, pesticides, herbicides, uranium, and more (Neilsen Research Corporation). Each of these contaminants poses dangerous side effects. For example, consumption of too much copper can lead to liver damage and kidney disease. Lead, on the other hand, generally comes from the pipes that the water travels through, and it can have life-altering effects on developing children (slowed growth, anemia, lower IQ, and more), pregnant woman (causing premature birth and reduced growth of the fetus), and adults (reproductive problems, decreased kidney function, and cardiovascular effects). Several cities are plagued with lead-infested water, including the now widely-known case of Flint, Michigan where city officials outright neglected the health crisis. Other cities have also had challenges with lead in their water supply infrastructure, including Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Some of the most contaminated water can be found in low-income rural areas, according to the New York Times, including areas of Oklahoma and Texas. Pharmaceuticals have also been found in water supplies that enter through the sewage system — through either human excrement (in the toilet) or when people flush their medication down the toilet. The WHO warns that we do not know the long-term effects of drinking trace amounts of pharmaceuticals – it is certainly not something we should consume daily. The chlorination treatment process that most tap water undergoes removes only about 50% of the pharmaceuticals from public water systems, according to WHO, but it depends on the type of drug, according to a study by Harvard. It’s not just foreign contaminants that prove to be an issue in our tap water — it’s also byproducts of the treatment process itself. Introducing chlorine into our water system produces halogenated disinfection byproducts (DPS), which has shown a link to bladder cancer as well as reproductive and developmental effects. Every city has a water supply with a unique combination of contaminants, and you can check your local report using the EWC’s Tap Water Database by entering your zip code. You may also refer to the EPA’s comprehensive list of regulations for known contaminants and their acceptable levels. Ultimately, tap water is regulated by the EPA who sets limits on 90+ contaminants in our water supply through the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), though the policy only applies to public water systems that serve more than 10,000 people. Communities smaller than 10,000 are not regulated under the SDWA — instead, they are monitored every five years for only 30 contaminants through the UCMR (Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule) by the EPA. Fluoride has been added to the majority of the US public water system since the 1960s, but not without controversy. Historically, fluoride has been added to our water to aid in the prevention of cavities, and there has been much debate about the health risks associated with ingesting this gas (yep - fluoride is a gas). As of 2014, about 74% of people with community water systems (public water) received fluoridation, varying by state (Hawaii has the lowest rate at 11.7% while Washington DC has 100% fluoridation rates), according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Ironically, the overall rate of cavities across the globe is decreasing for all populations regardless of fluoride treatment, Harvard reports. We can probably attribute toothpaste, electronic toothbrushes, as well as increased education on dental hygiene for this overall decrease in cavities. Unfortunately, fluoride doesn’t simply levitate on your teeth, research shows a number of various concerns about the ingestion of fluoride and how it affects cognition. A 2014 research study found that fluoride poses “significant costs in relation to cognitive impairment, hypothyroidism, dental and skeletal fluorosis, enzyme and electrolyte derangement, and uterine cancer.” It has not been proven that ingesting fluoride via your tap water is the best way to prevent cavities — most dental hygiene products that contain Fluoride are equally, if not more effective. Despite the fact that you can buy “mineral water” in bottled form, there are usually trace amounts of naturally occurring minerals in your tap water as well. These include calcium, magnesium, and sodium which were all found in levels that are high enough to support healthy intake. Those minerals are sometimes stripped, however, according to a research study out of Washington University in St. Louis and vary from city to city. Despite common misconception, bottled water doesn’t prove to be a safer or cleaner alternative to tap water. In addition to the energy usage and the abundance of plastic waste it creates on our planet, bottled water hasn't been shown to be safer for human consumption or lower in contaminants. And while tap water is regulated by the EPA, bottled water is regulated by the FDA which has an entirely different set of guidelines that are more focused on labeling (they do have some regulations, but not as substantial as the EPA). A 2014 study also showed that BPA and PET will leach into plastic water bottles if they are left in warm conditions (borosilicate glass bottles are a much safer alternative to store water and will not leach contaminants). And as you’ve probably heard, plastic bottled water is often just tap water that has been repackaged from your local municipal line and resold to you. In many cases, they are selling you something (bottled tap water) that you can generally access yourself, for free. Another option to consider is spring water. Spring water (sometimes called raw water or live water) comes directly from natural springs without excessive treatment or filtering. Natural springs are large aquifers (deep underground lakes), that are far removed from human waste and surface contamination. Compared to tap water, spring water avoids fluoridation and chlorination. Another benefit of spring water is that it does not travel through hundreds of miles of age-old pipes since it is bottled at the source. Natural spring water hosts a number of potential health benefits including a higher mineral count than tap water; It’s’s alkaline and helps balance the acidity in your body, and provides live probiotics derived from the (good) bacteria found in spring water. If you would like to try spring water, it’s suggested to do so through a professional delivery service which conducts third-party testing on its water supply. Spring water is a naturally occurring mineral-rich source of water and it is how humans have been consuming water for millennia – but as with all forms of untreated water, the source must be verified to ensure the water has not been running above ground, risking the intrusion of pesticides or contamination. It’s clear that we have several variables to consider before committing to a specific water source for our daily hydration needs. Clean, mineral-rich water is integral to mind and body wellness, as well as households with developing children. Without a doubt, drinking tap water exposes you to chemicals and contaminants. It is only regulated for relative safety markers, and for some families, it is simply the most affordable option. Some households may choose to purchase a water filtration system to remove the remaining contaminants in tap water. For example, reverse osmosis is a very strong filtration process that many people use, however, it is so powerful that it removes virtually all of the minerals (both good and bad). If you’re traveling abroad to a location that does not have safe drinking water, bottled water may be the safest option, or you can bring a water bottle that filters local tap.

                    FREE U.S. SHIPPING - ORDERS $75+  Let’s talk about tap water. Many of us in the United States have easy access to tap water at home and in restaurants. But what exactly is in our tap water? Where does it come from and is it safe to drink? In this article, we explore everything you need to know about tap water, one of the most overlooked staples in your diet. Tap water in the United States comes primarily from three sources — lakes, rivers, and groundwater. The source of your tap water depends entirely on where you are located. With over 100,000 lakes and 250,000 rivers across the US, plus hundreds of reservoirs, there’s a lot of variance in water sources for Americans. Some cities, like Boston and San Francisco, get 100% of their drinking water from reservoirs, while other cities rely on rivers and lakes, or a combination of both. For example: Though it is rare, some water is supplied from newer sources like seawater in San Diego County. While the majority of the world’s water exists in the oceans, very few cities are converting saltwater into drinking water. Desalination (the process of converting seawater to drinking water) is cost prohibitive and the lack of technology makes it a challenging investment for most cities. The cost per gallon from a desalination plant can cost consumers up to 2.5x more per month. From the source, your water is sent to a treatment facility to be processed and sanitized before it is directed to your faucet. There are four steps in the treatment process: coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. The first step, coagulation and flocculation is a process in which chemicals are added to the water to clump small particles together. This process helps form larger particles that can be easily filtered out. The common reagents added during this process include aluminum salts, polymers, iron, activated carbons, talcum, and activated silica. When they bind together, this is called “floc.” The sedimentation process occurs next when the floc settles at the bottom of the tank. Once the floc has settled, water is then filtered to remove any fine particles of dust, parasites, microorganisms, bacteria, and chemicals.  Finally, the water is disinfected to ensure any remaining microbial contaminants are destroyed. To do so, chemicals such as chlorine, chlorinates, or chlorine dioxides are added to the water. Disinfecting the water with these chemicals is a quick way to prevent outbreaks of waterborne infections and parasitic diseases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This is also the stage where some cities add fluoride to prevent tooth decay — don’t worry, we’ll dive into that further. Tap water is relatively safe. However, some of the most common contaminants that remain in our tap water after treatment include aluminum, arsenic, copper, iron, lead, pesticides, herbicides, uranium, and more (Neilsen Research Corporation). Each of these contaminants poses dangerous side effects. For example, consumption of too much copper can lead to liver damage and kidney disease. Lead, on the other hand, generally comes from the pipes that the water travels through, and it can have life-altering effects on developing children (slowed growth, anemia, lower IQ, and more), pregnant woman (causing premature birth and reduced growth of the fetus), and adults (reproductive problems, decreased kidney function, and cardiovascular effects). Several cities are plagued with lead-infested water, including the now widely-known case of Flint, Michigan where city officials outright neglected the health crisis. Other cities have also had challenges with lead in their water supply infrastructure, including Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Some of the most contaminated water can be found in low-income rural areas, according to the New York Times, including areas of Oklahoma and Texas. Pharmaceuticals have also been found in water supplies that enter through the sewage system — through either human excrement (in the toilet) or when people flush their medication down the toilet. The WHO warns that we do not know the long-term effects of drinking trace amounts of pharmaceuticals – it is certainly not something we should consume daily. The chlorination treatment process that most tap water undergoes removes only about 50% of the pharmaceuticals from public water systems, according to WHO, but it depends on the type of drug, according to a study by Harvard. It’s not just foreign contaminants that prove to be an issue in our tap water — it’s also byproducts of the treatment process itself. Introducing chlorine into our water system produces halogenated disinfection byproducts (DPS), which has shown a link to bladder cancer as well as reproductive and developmental effects. Every city has a water supply with a unique combination of contaminants, and you can check your local report using the EWC’s Tap Water Database by entering your zip code. You may also refer to the EPA’s comprehensive list of regulations for known contaminants and their acceptable levels. Ultimately, tap water is regulated by the EPA who sets limits on 90+ contaminants in our water supply through the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), though the policy only applies to public water systems that serve more than 10,000 people. Communities smaller than 10,000 are not regulated under the SDWA — instead, they are monitored every five years for only 30 contaminants through the UCMR (Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule) by the EPA. Fluoride has been added to the majority of the US public water system since the 1960s, but not without controversy. Historically, fluoride has been added to our water to aid in the prevention of cavities, and there has been much debate about the health risks associated with ingesting this gas (yep - fluoride is a gas). As of 2014, about 74% of people with community water systems (public water) received fluoridation, varying by state (Hawaii has the lowest rate at 11.7% while Washington DC has 100% fluoridation rates), according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Ironically, the overall rate of cavities across the globe is decreasing for all populations regardless of fluoride treatment, Harvard reports. We can probably attribute toothpaste, electronic toothbrushes, as well as increased education on dental hygiene for this overall decrease in cavities. Unfortunately, fluoride doesn’t simply levitate on your teeth, research shows a number of various concerns about the ingestion of fluoride and how it affects cognition. A 2014 research study found that fluoride poses “significant costs in relation to cognitive impairment, hypothyroidism, dental and skeletal fluorosis, enzyme and electrolyte derangement, and uterine cancer.” It has not been proven that ingesting fluoride via your tap water is the best way to prevent cavities — most dental hygiene products that contain Fluoride are equally, if not more effective. Despite the fact that you can buy “mineral water” in bottled form, there are usually trace amounts of naturally occurring minerals in your tap water as well. These include calcium, magnesium, and sodium which were all found in levels that are high enough to support healthy intake. Those minerals are sometimes stripped, however, according to a research study out of Washington University in St. Louis and vary from city to city. Despite common misconception, bottled water doesn’t prove to be a safer or cleaner alternative to tap water. In addition to the energy usage and the abundance of plastic waste it creates on our planet, bottled water hasn&#x27;t been shown to be safer for human consumption or lower in contaminants. And while tap water is regulated by the EPA, bottled water is regulated by the FDA which has an entirely different set of guidelines that are more focused on labeling (they do have some regulations, but not as substantial as the EPA). A 2014 study also showed that BPA and PET will leach into plastic water bottles if they are left in warm conditions (borosilicate glass bottles are a much safer alternative to store water and will not leach contaminants). And as you’ve probably heard, plastic bottled water is often just tap water that has been repackaged from your local municipal line and resold to you. In many cases, they are selling you something (bottled tap water) that you can generally access yourself, for free. Another option to consider is spring water. Spring water (sometimes called raw water or live water) comes directly from natural springs without excessive treatment or filtering. Natural springs are large aquifers (deep underground lakes), that are far removed from human waste and surface contamination. Compared to tap water, spring water avoids fluoridation and chlorination. Another benefit of spring water is that it does not travel through hundreds of miles of age-old pipes since it is bottled at the source. Natural spring water hosts a number of potential health benefits including a higher mineral count than tap water; It’s’s alkaline and helps balance the acidity in your body, and provides live probiotics derived from the (good) bacteria found in spring water. If you would like to try spring water, it’s suggested to do so through a professional delivery service which conducts third-party testing on its water supply. Spring water is a naturally occurring mineral-rich source of water and it is how humans have been consuming water for millennia – but as with all forms of untreated water, the source must be verified to ensure the water has not been running above ground, risking the intrusion of pesticides or contamination. It’s clear that we have several variables to consider before committing to a specific water source for our daily hydration needs. Clean, mineral-rich water is integral to mind and body wellness, as well as households with developing children. Without a doubt, drinking tap water exposes you to chemicals and contaminants. It is only regulated for relative safety markers, and for some families, it is simply the most affordable option. Some households may choose to purchase a water filtration system to remove the remaining contaminants in tap water. For example, reverse osmosis is a very strong filtration process that many people use, however, it is so powerful that it removes virtually all of the minerals (both good and bad). If you’re traveling abroad to a location that does not have safe drinking water, bottled water may be the safest option, or you can bring a water bottle that filters local tap. Spring water is the most “true to the source” option, maintaining natural minerals from the spring, but also comes with some risk if the water is not sourced properly – there are trusted spring water delivery services that can be easily found with a quick Google Search. Clean water remains a fundamental requirement for proper cellular and vital organ function. In the end, only you can decide which option is best for you and your family, and which risks and benefits are aligned with your health goals.   – p.s. have you joined our newsletter yet? Subscribe to get occasional updates with green-living tips, stories from people who inspire us, special promos and more.

             Latest Earthquakes |   Live WebChat Share Social Media  At least 45% of the nation’s tap water is estimated to have one or more types of the chemicals known as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, or PFAS, according to a new study by the U.S. Geological Survey. There are more than 12,000 types of PFAS, not all of which can be detected with current tests; the USGS study tested for the presence of 32 types.  This USGS research marks the first time anyone has tested for and compared PFAS in tap water from both private and government-regulated public water supplies on a broad scale throughout the country. Those data were used to model and estimate PFAS contamination nationwide. This USGS study can help members of the public to understand their risk of exposure and inform policy and management decisions regarding testing and treatment options for drinking water.  PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals used in a wide variety of common applications, from the linings of fast-food boxes and non-stick cookware to fire-fighting foams and other purposes. High concentrations of some PFAS may lead to adverse health risks in people, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Research is still ongoing to better understand the potential health effects of PFAS exposure over long periods of time. Because they break down very slowly, PFAS are commonly called “forever chemicals.” Their persistence in the environment and prevalence across the country make them a unique water-quality concern.  "USGS scientists tested water collected directly from people’s kitchen sinks across the nation, providing the most comprehensive study to date on PFAS in tap water from both private wells and public supplies,” said USGS research hydrologist Kelly Smalling, the study’s lead author. “The study estimates that at least one type of PFAS – of those that were monitored – could be present in nearly half of the tap water in the U.S. Furthermore, PFAS concentrations were similar between public supplies and private wells.”   The EPA regulates public water supplies, and homeowners are responsible for the maintenance, testing and treatment of private water supplies. Those interested in testing and treating private wells should contact their local and state officials for guidance. Testing is the only way to confirm the presence of these contaminants in wells. For more information about PFAS regulations, visit the EPA’s website on addressing PFAS.  The study tested for 32 individual PFAS compounds using a method developed by the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory. The most frequently detected compounds in this study were PFBS, PFHxS and PFOA. The interim health advisories released by the EPA in 2022 for PFOS and PFOA were exceeded in every sample in which they were detected in this study.  Scientists collected tap water samples from 716 locations representing a range of low, medium and high human-impacted areas. The low category includes protected lands; medium includes residential and rural areas with no known PFAS sources; and high includes urban areas and locations with reported PFAS sources such as industry or waste sites.   Most of the exposure was observed near urban areas and potential PFAS sources. This included the Great Plains, Great Lakes, Eastern Seaboard, and Central/Southern California regions. The study’s results are in line with previous research concluding that people in urban areas have a higher likelihood of PFAS exposure. USGS scientists estimate that the probability of PFAS not being observed in tap water is about 75% in rural areas and around 25% in urban areas.   Learn more about USGS research on PFAS by reading the USGS strategy for the study of PFAS and visiting the PFAS Integrated Science Team’s website. The new study builds upon previous research by the USGS and partners regarding human-derived contaminants, including PFAS, in drinking water and PFAS in groundwater.  Drinking-water quality and potential exposures to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at the point-of-use (tapwater) are a rising concern in the United States (US).

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Where does my drinking water come from? The United States has one of the safest and most reliable drinking water systems in the world. Every year, millions of people living in the United States get their tap water from a public community water system. The drinking water that is supplied to our homes comes from either a surface water or ground water source. Surface water collects in streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Ground water is water located below the ground where it collects in pores and spaces within rocks and in underground aquifers. We get ground water by drilling wells and pumping it to the surface. Water travels to your tap from a surface water or ground water source through your local water utility or through an individual water system, such as a private well. A private well uses ground water as its water source. Owners of private wells and other individual water systems are responsible for ensuring that their water is safe from contaminants.  Top of Page How is my drinking water regulated? All public water systems in the United States are required to follow the standards and regulations set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA regulations that protect public water systems do not apply to privately owned wells or other individual water systems. Owners of private wells are responsible for ensuring that their well water is safe from contaminants. What type of health issues can be related to water quality? Contaminants in our water can lead to health issues, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems may be at increased risk for becoming sick after drinking contaminated water. For example, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Federal law requires that systems reduce certain contaminants to set levels in order to protect human health. How do I know that the water in my home is safe to drink? EPA is responsible for making sure that public water supplies within the United States are safe. In 1974, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act. This law sought to protect the nation’s public drinking water supply by giving EPA authority to set the standards for drinking water quality and oversee the states, localities, and water suppliers who implement those standards. In 1986 and 1996, the law was amended to protect drinking water and its sources, which include rivers, lakes, reservoirs, springs, and ground water wells. How do germs and chemicals get into my drinking water? There can be many sources of contamination of our water systems. The most common sources of contaminants include: EPA regulates many contaminants that pose known human health risks. EPA makes sure that water meets certain standards, so you can be sure that high levels of contaminants are not in your water. How do I filter water at my home if I am concerned about water quality? Different water filters have different functions. Some can make your water taste better, while others can remove harmful chemicals or germs. Visit CDC’s filter page to learn more about home water filters. How do I remove the parasite Cryptosporidium from my drinking water? The parasite Cryptosporidium can survive a long time, even after the water is treated with chlorine or iodine. Cryptosporidium can be removed from water by filtering through a reverse osmosis filter, an “absolute one micron” filter, or a filter certified to remove Cryptosporidium under NSF International Standard #53 for either “cyst removal” or “cyst reduction.”  Filtering does not remove bacteria and viruses. Ultraviolet light treatment of water is not effective against Cryptosporidium at normally used levels. How can I find out if there has been a violation in our public water standard? When water quality standards have not been met, your public water system must alert and notify customers if there is a risk to their health. Your annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) is another way to find out about the water quality in your area, and find information regarding contaminants, possible health effects, and the water’s source.  Top of Page Who do I need to contact to find out more information about water quality in my area? Every community water supplier must provide an annual report to its customers,  known as a Consumer Confidence Report (CCR). The report provides information on your local drinking water quality, including the water’s source, contaminants found in the water, and how consumers can get involved in protecting drinking water. Visit EPA’s website to find your local CCR. How often does the local public water system test my drinking water? Frequency of drinking water testing depends on the number of people served, the type of water source, and types of contaminants. Certain contaminants are tested more frequently than others, as established by the Safe Drinking Water Act. You can find out about levels of regulated contaminants in your treated water for the previous calendar year in your annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR). What common contaminants are included in this testing? EPA sets standards and regulations for the presence and amount of over 90 different contaminants in public drinking water, including E.coli, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium species. Visit EPA’s Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List and Regulatory Determination website for more information. What should I do if I want my household water tested? The United States has one of the safest public water supplies in the world. However, if you are concerned about contaminants in your home’s water system, contact your state drinking water certification officer to obtain a list of certified laboratories in your state. Depending on how many contaminants you wish to test for, the cost of a water test can range from $15 to hundreds of dollars. Visit EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Information website if you have questions on testing methods. Who should I contact if my water has a funny smell, taste, or appearance? A change in your water’s taste, color, or smell is not necessarily a health concern. However, sometimes a change can be a sign of problems. If you notice a change in your water, call your public water system company. If you want to test your water, your local health department should assist in explaining any tests that you need for various contaminants. If your local health department is not able to help, contact a state certified laboratory to perform the test. To find a state certified laboratory in your area, call the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 or visit the State Certified Drinking Water Laboratories list.  Top of Page How do I find out if there is a boil water advisory or other water advisory in my community? Your public water system is responsible for notifying residents if the water quality does not meet EPA or state standards, or if there is a waterborne disease emergency. EPA sets guidelines for when residents must be notified depending on the seriousness of a contamination event. You should be notified by media outlets such as TV or radio, mail, or other communication channels. There are three levels of public notification: If there is a boil water advisory in my community, how do I disinfect my drinking water? To disinfect your drinking water during a boil water advisory, you should boil your water at a rolling boil for at least 1 minute (at elevations above 6,500 feet, boil water for 3 minutes). Boiling your water for at least 1 minute at a rolling boil will kill all harmful bacteria, parasites, and viruses from drinking water. You can also treat small volumes of drinking water by using a chemical disinfectant, such as unscented household chlorine bleach or by using a water filter. Visit CDC’s make water safe page for more information.  Top of Page What are the main types of ground water wells? According to EPA, there are three basic types of private drinking wells: dug, drilled, and driven. Proper well construction and continued maintenance are critical to the safety of your water supply. It is important to know what type of well you have. Well type affects how likely your water is to become contaminated and what kind of maintenance procedures you should follow. You may be able to determine the type of well you have by looking at the outer casing and cover of the well. As a private well owner, should I have my well tested? Yes, as a private well owner, you are responsible for testing your well to ensure the water is safe to drink. EPA is responsible for making sure that the public water supply within the United States is safe. However, EPA does not monitor or treat private well drinking water. For information on testing your well water, visit Drinking Water’s Well Testing page. What germs and chemicals should I test for in my well? Several water quality indicators (WQIs) and contaminants that should be tested for in your water are listed below. A WQI test is a test that measures the presence and amount of certain germs in water. In most cases, WQIs do not cause sickness; however, they are easy to test for and their presence may indicate the presence of sewage and other disease-causing germs from human and/or animal feces (poop). For more information on these contaminants and WQIs, please see the Drinking Water’s Well Testing page. Water Quality Indicators: Contaminants: Other germs or harmful chemicals that you should test for will depend on where your well is located on your property, which state you live in, and whether you live in an urban or rural area. These tests could include testing for lead, arsenic, mercury, radium, atrazine, and other pesticides. You should check with your local health or environmental department to find out if any of these contaminants are a problem in your region. Please remember that if your test results say there are germs or chemicals in your water, you should contact your local health or environmental department for help in interpreting the test, ask for guidance on how to respond to the contamination, and test your water more often. When should I have my well tested? You should have your well tested once a year for total coliform bacteria, nitrates, total dissolved solids, and pH levels. If you suspect other contaminants, you should test for those as well. However, spend time identifying potential problems first, as these tests can be expensive. You should also have your well tested if: Who should test my well? State and local health or environmental departments often test for nitrates, total coliforms, fecal coliforms, volatile organic compounds, and pH. Health or environmental departments, or county governments should also have a list of the state-certified (licensed) laboratories in your area that test for a variety of Water Quality Indicators (WQIs) and contaminants. For more information, visit EPA’s pages below or contact your local health department: My well water has a funny smell or taste; should I worry about getting sick? Any time you notice a significant change in your water quality, you should have it tested. A change in your water’s taste, color, or smell is not necessarily a health concern. However, sometimes changes can be a sign of problems. How do germs and chemicals get into my well water? A private well uses ground water as its water source. There are many sources of contamination of ground water. Some of the most common sources of contaminants include: To receive updates highlighting our recent work to prevent infectious disease, enter your email address:

                    Where does my drinking water come from? The United States has one of the safest and most reliable drinking water systems in the world. Every year, millions of people living in the United States get their tap water from a public community water system. The drinking water that is supplied to our homes comes from either a surface water or ground water source. Surface water collects in streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Ground water is water located below the ground where it collects in pores and spaces within rocks and in underground aquifers. We get ground water by drilling wells and pumping it to the surface. Water travels to your tap from a surface water or ground water source through your local water utility or through an individual water system, such as a private well. A private well uses ground water as its water source. Owners of private wells and other individual water systems are responsible for ensuring that their water is safe from contaminants.  Top of Page How is my drinking water regulated? All public water systems in the United States are required to follow the standards and regulations set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA regulations that protect public water systems do not apply to privately owned wells or other individual water systems. Owners of private wells are responsible for ensuring that their well water is safe from contaminants. What type of health issues can be related to water quality? Contaminants in our water can lead to health issues, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems may be at increased risk for becoming sick after drinking contaminated water. For example, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Federal law requires that systems reduce certain contaminants to set levels in order to protect human health. How do I know that the water in my home is safe to drink? EPA is responsible for making sure that public water supplies within the United States are safe. In 1974, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act. This law sought to protect the nation’s public drinking water supply by giving EPA authority to set the standards for drinking water quality and oversee the states, localities, and water suppliers who implement those standards. In 1986 and 1996, the law was amended to protect drinking water and its sources, which include rivers, lakes, reservoirs, springs, and ground water wells. How do germs and chemicals get into my drinking water? There can be many sources of contamination of our water systems. The most common sources of contaminants include: EPA regulates many contaminants that pose known human health risks. EPA makes sure that water meets certain standards, so you can be sure that high levels of contaminants are not in your water. How do I filter water at my home if I am concerned about water quality? Different water filters have different functions. Some can make your water taste better, while others can remove harmful chemicals or germs. Visit CDC’s filter page to learn more about home water filters. How do I remove the parasite Cryptosporidium from my drinking water? The parasite Cryptosporidium can survive a long time, even after the water is treated with chlorine or iodine. Cryptosporidium can be removed from water by filtering through a reverse osmosis filter, an “absolute one micron” filter, or a filter certified to remove Cryptosporidium under NSF International Standard #53 for either “cyst removal” or “cyst reduction.”  Filtering does not remove bacteria and viruses. Ultraviolet light treatment of water is not effective against Cryptosporidium at normally used levels. How can I find out if there has been a violation in our public water standard? When water quality standards have not been met, your public water system must alert and notify customers if there is a risk to their health. Your annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) is another way to find out about the water quality in your area, and find information regarding contaminants, possible health effects, and the water’s source.  Top of Page Who do I need to contact to find out more information about water quality in my area? Every community water supplier must provide an annual report to its customers,  known as a Consumer Confidence Report (CCR). The report provides information on your local drinking water quality, including the water’s source, contaminants found in the water, and how consumers can get involved in protecting drinking water. Visit EPA’s website to find your local CCR. How often does the local public water system test my drinking water? Frequency of drinking water testing depends on the number of people served, the type of water source, and types of contaminants. Certain contaminants are tested more frequently than others, as established by the Safe Drinking Water Act. You can find out about levels of regulated contaminants in your treated water for the previous calendar year in your annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR). What common contaminants are included in this testing? EPA sets standards and regulations for the presence and amount of over 90 different contaminants in public drinking water, including E.coli, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium species. Visit EPA’s Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List and Regulatory Determination website for more information. What should I do if I want my household water tested? The United States has one of the safest public water supplies in the world. However, if you are concerned about contaminants in your home’s water system, contact your state drinking water certification officer to obtain a list of certified laboratories in your state. Depending on how many contaminants you wish to test for, the cost of a water test can range from $15 to hundreds of dollars. Visit EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Information website if you have questions on testing methods. Who should I contact if my water has a funny smell, taste, or appearance? A change in your water’s taste, color, or smell is not necessarily a health concern. However, sometimes a change can be a sign of problems. If you notice a change in your water, call your public water system company. If you want to test your water, your local health department should assist in explaining any tests that you need for various contaminants. If your local health department is not able to help, contact a state certified laboratory to perform the test. To find a state certified laboratory in your area, call the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 or visit the State Certified Drinking Water Laboratories list.  Top of Page How do I find out if there is a boil water advisory or other water advisory in my community? Your public water system is responsible for notifying residents if the water quality does not meet EPA or state standards, or if there is a waterborne disease emergency. EPA sets guidelines for when residents must be notified depending on the seriousness of a contamination event. You should be notified by media outlets such as TV or radio, mail, or other communication channels. There are three levels of public notification: If there is a boil water advisory in my community, how do I disinfect my drinking water?

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: The debate between drinking tap water or bottled water seems to be endless. In most parts of the United States and Canada, it’s safe to drink tap water from public water systems. Tap water that’s been properly filtered is equally safe as bottled water and provides you with essential minerals you may not get from bottled water.  Even though it’s usually safe to drink tap water, it’s still a good idea to keep an eye out for local water advisories in your area. Situations like a broken water line or equipment failure at the water treatment plant can lead to temporary contamination. You may also want to stick to bottled water when traveling to developing countries that don’t have the same level of infrastructure or safety standards. For example, a 2017 research review showed that Mexico’s maximum allowable limit of arsenic in drinking water is 2.5 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommendation. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about drinking tap water in North America. Even tap water that’s safe to drink isn’t made up of 100 percent water. You can also find traces of minerals and small amounts of containments at levels deemed to be safe for human health. The mineral fluoride is added to water in the United States to help strengthen your teeth. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), studies have found drinking fluoridated water prevents your risk of tooth decay by about 25 percent. Disinfectants like chlorine or chloramine are added to drinking water to kill germs that can make you sick. These disinfectants are added in very small amounts that haven’t been found to cause harmful health effects in humans. For example, the CDC says that chlorine levels up to 4 parts per million are considered safe for human consumption. Tap water contains minerals that are essential for human health. Some of these minerals occur naturally and some are added. According to a 2013 study, drinking a quart of tap water provides you with about 1 percent of your daily required copper, calcium, magnesium, and sodium. The researchers found no significant differences in the overall mineral content of water extracted from 144 sampling locations across the United States. Tap water also contains other minerals, such as: The taste of tap water can differ depending on the amounts and ratios of minerals dissolved in it. For instance, high levels of iron may give your water a metallic taste. Even water considered safe can contain traces of contaminants in amounts not deemed to be dangerous for human health. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has limits on more than 90 potential substances that may be unsafe for humans. For example, the limit for arsenic is 10 parts per billion. There also might be a microscopic amount of other contaminants in your water that aren’t harmful to your health, such as soil or sediment. According to the EPA, water can be contaminated with various types of pollutants that may make it unsafe. Tap water can contain microorganisms like bacteria or parasites that make you sick. If potentially dangerous microorganisms are detected in tap water, your local health authority will likely declare a “boil water advisory.” Cryptosporidium, E. coli, and Giardia are three harmful organisms that can leak into drinking water through sewage. Both human-made and natural chemicals can make their way into drinking water. Pesticides, bleach, and bacterial toxins are some of the potential things that can have harmful health effects. Other chemicals like bisphenol-A and pharmaceuticals are also sometimes detected in groundwater sources. Often these chemicals are filtered before reaching your tap. Radioactive elements chemicals like uranium, cesium, plutonium are sometimes detected in drinking water. These elements can emit ionizing radiation that can harm cells in your body and raise your risk of developing cancer.  Other types of ionizing radiation people are exposed to include X-rays and ultraviolet light.  Heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, or lead can enter your water supply through plumbing and service lines as well as through natural mineral deposits. The EPA says that people who consume a lot of these minerals may develop sudden or long-term toxicity that’s linked to: Certain groups of people are more sensitive to containments. They include: Children, babies, and fetuses have less blood volume than adults, and contaminants like heavy metals can have a greater effect on them. People who are immunocompromised may be more vulnerable to bacteria and parasites.  Congress enacted the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974 to ensure the quality of public water systems in the United States. According to the CDC, the United States has one of the safest water systems in the world. All public water systems follow guidelines set by the EPA. However, the EPA doesn’t monitor private wells. The EPA says that more than 13 million homes in the United States get their water from private wells. It’s up to the well owner to make sure the water is safe for consumption. Most of the time, your local health authority will send out an alert if your water supply becomes contaminated. In very rare cases, contaminants may enter public water systems and go unnoticed. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Flint, Michigan, officials failed to take action when residents complained about the taste and smell of their drinking water in 2014. It was later discovered that more than 100,000 people were exposed to high levels of lead that would prompt President Barack Obama to declare a federal state of emergency.  Like in the United States, Canadian drinking water goes through rigorous safety standards and is generally safe to drink. Health Canada’s Water and Air Quality Bureauworks with provinces, territories, and municipalities to develop guidelines for water safety. Canadians and people visiting Canada should still keep an eye out for local water advisories. The drinking water in many areas in Mexico isn’t safe to drink. A 2018 study found that only 7 percent of people in Guadalajara, Mexico’s third-largest metro area, drink the tap water. Even in areas where water is purified, water can often be contaminated by pipes or water holding tanks. Travelers are often recommended to buy bottled water in Mexico. Every year, you should receive a Consumer Confidence Report from your local water supplier by July 1, telling you your water source and what’s in it. You can also search for your local CCR from the EPA website. According to the World Health Organization, you’re largely unable to determine the quality of your water using your own senses. A strange taste, appearance, or odor may indicate pollution or malfunction during water treatment. But in some cases, these abnormalities may be caused by the mineral content. Drinking tap water that’s contaminated with microorganisms can lead to gastrointestinal illness. Common symptoms include: You can also develop hepatitis from contaminated drinking water, which is especially likely to cause severe health effects in people who are immunocompromised. Microorganisms that cause life threatening conditions like typhoid or cholera are rare in the United States. Exposure to chemicals can cause short-term or long-term effects. According to the EPA, high doses of chemicals can cause symptoms that include: Local health officials sometimes issue boil water advisories to kill germs that may make you sick. If you don’t have access to bottled water during a boil water advisory, the CDC recommends bringing tap water to a rolling boil for 1 minute and then allowing the water to cool before using it. Bottled water and water filters are both potential alternatives to tap water. The FDA oversees the safety of bottled water. Normally, bottled water and tap water are both considered very safe in the United States. Bottled water is the better choice in areas where tap water isn’t safe to drink or if there’s a water advisory. Many types of home water filters are available. Some filters attach directly to your sink, and some brands sell pitchers with filters in them. Not all water filters make your water safer. Some water filters are only designed to improve the taste.  Tap water is generally safe to drink in the United States and Canada, but you should watch for water advisories released by your local health authority. A breakage in a water line or malfunction at the treatment plant can lead to temporary contamination. When visiting developing countries such as Mexico, you may want to avoid the tap water to be safe.

When visiting developing countries such as Mexico, you may want to avoid the tap water to be safe.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Experts weigh in on the chemicals that can be found in drinking water, how it’s regulated, and what you can do if you’re worried about your water. Most U.S. residents don’t need to worry about the safety of their tap water, but millions of Americans are still exposed to contaminants every year.  It can take a water crisis to highlight where drinking water infrastructure is failing. One of the most devastating water crises in recent memory was the lead contamination in Flint, Michigan's drinking water in 2014. As of January 2023, nine years after the initial contamination, residents are still dealing with the effects. And last year, a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi left many of the city’s 150,000 residents without potable water, a problem that persists today.  Here, drinking water experts from the EPA, academia, and advocacy groups weigh in on what you need to know about your tap.  In the U.S., about 90 percent of people get their tap water from a public water system (PWS). Water from a lake, reservoir, river or aquifer is piped into a water treatment facility where chemicals are added to the water that bind to pollutants and are sifted out of the system. Some facilities also use bacteria-killing UV light.  Chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or chloramine are then added to the water to help kill any pathogens remaining in the water and any that might be lurking in your pipes when the water travels to your home.  Some water treatment facilities, from lack of funding or too little oversight, don’t effectively clean their water. In 2015, about 21 million people living in the U.S. were exposed to tap water that violated federal guidelines, according to a study published in 2018.  Unsafe and therefore illegal levels of pathogens (bacteria and viruses), nitrates, arsenic, and harmful byproducts from disinfectants like chlorine were the most common sources of violations, says Maura Allaire, study author and a water quality expert at the University of California, Irvine. In 1974, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act, which gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate public tap water.  When something like lead, for example, is shown to be harmful to human health, the EPA can set a limit for how much is allowed in water supplies. Limits are based on what amount is safe for human consumption and what is technologically feasible for water treatment facilities to accomplish.  But these limits don’t always result in water that is contaminant free.  “There’s a gap between what is legal and what is safe,” says Sydney Evans, a science analyst at the Environmental Working Group (EWG). She adds that many regulations are based on decades-old science, which the EWG has argued makes regulations outdated and insufficient. The EWG maintains their own tap water database where they set much stricter limits than the EPA, based on what they consider to be safe for human health. Their limits are determined by peer-reviewed studies, research done by state agencies, and staff scientists.  Type “drinking water” into your search bar, and lately you’re likely to see articles about how it’s full of PFAS, pollutants sometimes referred to as “forever chemicals.” PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) is a group of thousands of chemicals with tight chemically-bound bonds that help them last in the environment for years. Certain PFAS compounds have been linked to serious health issues, such as cancer. Recently, the EPA proposed new limits on six of these chemicals in drinking water. Studies conducted on drinking water show PFAS is common in drinking water supplies throughout the U.S., and as a result, these chemicals have been found in our blood. The EPA rules proposed this month would be the first to meaningfully address PFAS pollution at the federal level and paves a way to remove a toxin that’s been contaminating drinking water for decades. New rules for currently unregulated contaminants will take time. PFAS, for instance, have been a known hazard for years, but it required large amounts of evidence and research before a rule could be proposed.  “There is a significant challenge,” Eric Burneson, a director at the EPA’s Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water, says of proposing new regulations. “We need robust scientific information, and we need peer review of that information. We need to know about our ability to manage it. Can we measure it? Can we treat it?” Answers to these questions help the EPA defend the potential cost of regulating a new chemical. In addition to the 90 contaminants the EPA already regulates, there are dozens more the agency has identified as a threat to health and in tap water. They include 66 chemicals, 12 microbes, and all PFAS—instead of the six they recently proposed to limit.  “We need further information to move forward,” says Burneson of regulating potentially harmful chemicals, but he adds, “They may be in drinking water, and they pose risks.”  Rural, low-income communities face the most trouble accessing clean tap water; water treatment facilities there are most likely to violate EPA standards. Proximity to agricultural pollution, contaminated groundwater, and underfunded or understaffed treatment facilities put these communities at risk.  An analysis of three decades of drinking water violations in the U.S. found some states were more likely to have poorer quality drinking water than others. States with agricultural hubs were particularly at risk. Certain racial groups are also more likely to be exposed to poor drinking water. One study looking at California and Texas found Latino and Black communities faced a persistently higher cancer risk from their drinking water.   (An environmental advocate weighs in on inequality and safe drinking water.) The EPA requires water utilities to publish annual reports identifying any potential health hazards in the community about their water supply. (You can find yours here.)  When hazards emerge, securing clean drinking water can cost individuals.  For short-term emergencies like a boil water notice, bottled water can be a useful resource.   Bottled water bought and sold in the U.S. is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates water based on the same standards the EPA has in place for tap water. Studies done on bottled water have found it’s no cleaner or safer than well-regulated tap water, but it is sold at several times the price of tap water and promotes plastic waste, an emerging drinking water threat.  Filters are another option for addressing tap water concerns. They can be as simple as the relatively inexpensive filters that fit in your fridge or as complex as a thousand-dollar filtration system hooked up to home plumbing. There are about 3,000 electric utilities in the U.S. but over 50,000 water utilities. While some serve as many as eight million people, about half of those facilities serve fewer than 500. Those smaller utilities are less likely to have full time operators or enough customers to pay for maintenance.  With the right policies and enough funding, experts say clean tap water can be guaranteed for everyone. “We have the technical know-how to provide safe drinking water,” says Allaire. “It’s a policy question of how do we make this a reality?” Combining those smaller utilities, creating water contracts where one community purchases water from a larger utility, and paying for well-trained facility managers could all create more water for more communities.    Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2023 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Menu EWG Home November 2021 For too many Americans, turning on their faucets for a glass of water is like pouring a cocktail of chemicals. Lead, arsenic, the “forever chemicals” known as PFAS and many other substances are often found in drinking water at potentially unsafe levels, particularly in low-income and underserved communities. From the lead contamination crisis in Flint, Mich., to widespread radium pollution in Brady, Texas, the perils of unsafe water are finally prompting lawmakers and regulators to weigh how to act. What’s needed is major new federal funding to improve drinking water quality, pay for much-needed lead line replacements, help disadvantaged areas and start to tackle the widespread PFAS problem that has made headlines across the country. EWG’s landmark Tap Water Database shows how polluted drinking water can be, and why the efforts to fix it at the source are vital. The database collects mandatory annual test reports from 2014 to 2019, produced by almost 50,000 water utilities in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It reveals that when some Americans drink a glass of tap water, they're also potentially getting a dose of industrial or agricultural contaminants linked to cancer, brain and nervous system damage, fertility problems, hormone disruption and other health harms. And those risks likely increase in underserved communities, particularly those with higher Black or Latino populations. EWG’s research finds that people living in such areas might have a greater collective risk of cancer from the contaminants in their drinking water supplies than people in other parts of the country. Why does this unacceptable situation persist? One reason is that there is not enough funding to help replace lead pipelines and clean up our drinking water. Another is that federal water safety standards aren’t keeping pace with the latest science on contaminants – some regulations haven’t been updated in more than 50 years, and the Environmental Protection Agency is not moving fast enough on new drinking water rules. Ambitious efforts to safeguard the water we drink must achieve that goal for every American. It’s easy to be pessimistic about whether that idea is realistic, given that Flint is in  its seventh year  of the lead catastrophe. Yet an increased focus by Congress on drinking water funding, the rising and necessary role of environmental equity, and firm commitments for improvements by those with the power to make them happen all provide reason to be hopeful.  A growing number of Democratic and Republican lawmakers are advocating for legislation that would significantly boost funding to improve the quality of drinking water and end long-running pollution problems. Such spending would be an important move toward correcting a historic wrong – the fact that marginalized and low-income communities have the least access to safe drinking water. A recent report  by the Environmental Policy Innovation Center that analyzed the EPA’s drinking water funding program from 2011 to 2020 found that drinking water systems serving smaller communities and communities with greater numbers of people of color were less likely to receive assistance through the program. And without the resources to improve water quality, their systems will continue to suffer. Flint, a majority-Black city of roughly 100,000 people, may be the most prominent of many recent examples of people suffering with dirty drinking water. This type of situation occurs when water systems don’t get the funds they need to replace harmful lead pipes. It happens when people living in these areas have no option other than to  buy filters  to achieve cleaner water, even though they might not be able to afford them. It happens when rural communities have no choice but to drink polluted water from wells fouled by industrial agriculture – because there are no resources that provide safe drinking water supplies. It happens when pollution emergencies occur and communities are told to use bottled water. But this is not a long-term solution. And bottled water can contain contaminants and costs hundreds of times more than tap water. This means these communities are the ones that suffer most from the harmful effects of consuming unsafe drinking water. Fixing the situation requires a new approach – ensuring that much-needed aid is prioritized for underserved areas, so all communities can benefit from safer water. Just because the scale of the problem is vast does not mean it can’t be solved. Newark, N.J., took almost five years to  replace 20,000 lead lines  following detection of high lead levels in the city’s drinking water supplies. But the work is almost done, and just because it requires time and money is no reason not to do it. Disadvantaged communities that have shouldered an unfair burden of some of the most-polluted drinking water in the country must finally get the help they need, and only a major federal funding boost can achieve community-level improvements. But achieving true water equity also requires stricter safety standards to ensure that drinking water supplies no longer have pollution levels harmful to human health. The EPA and states do have some standards in place to protect drinking water supplies, but these limits on specific pollutants are often too weak to make the water safe to drink. Even when the standards are sufficiently stringent, a lack of resources to enforce the limits means the water remains unsafe, or that drinking water systems can’t fund the upgrades necessary to clean their supplies. The federal  Safe Drinking Water Act  , or SDWA, has helped to improve U.S. water quality. Enacted in 1974 and updated in 1986 and 1996, it established EPA standards for some contaminants, such as arsenic, copper and lead. But progress on regulating pollutants has stalled instead of keeping up with current science. The last time the EPA set a new legal limit for a drinking water pollutant was in 2000, when the agency took steps to lower uranium levels in tap water. Since then, Americans have continued to suffer from widespread drinking water contamination, particularly from emerging contaminants. This inaction at the federal level continues to exempt from adequate regulation PFAS, hexavalent chromium and more than 160 other unregulated contaminants that pollute tap water. Millions of people are exposed to unsafe drinking water as a result. For some other chemicals, the EPA’s maximum contaminant levels, or MCLs – the upper limit on a pollutant legally allowed in drinking water – haven’t been updated in 50 years. Yet there is extensive scientific research to justify the agency’s pursuit of much more stringent MCLs. The legal federal standard for nitrate, for example, is based on a recommendation from 1962, even though studies support lowering the current MCL by several orders of magnitude to protect against the risk of cancer. Drinking water standards are often based too heavily on cost concerns and political considerations. That’s why EWG, focused solely on what’s necessary to protect public health within an adequate margin of safety, has  suggested stricter standards  for several contaminants that would truly protect public health. Here’s the well-kept secret about existing drinking water standards: Legal doesn’t necessarily mean safe. The vast majority of the nation’s drinking water supplies get a passing grade from federal and state regulatory agencies. But many of the 324 contaminants detected by local utilities’ tests are found at levels that may be legal under EPA’s SDWA standards or state regulations – though they far exceed levels authoritative scientific studies have found to pose health risks. Even for chemicals that are regulated, the legal limit is often hundreds of times higher than the health standards recommended by scientists and public health agencies. Too often, legal limits are based more on what can be achieved in terms of treatment costs, and less on public health. And water treatment facilities in many communities, especially in rural areas, are outdated, overloaded or underfunded, as urgently needed investments in water infrastructure get postponed year after year. But even here, there’s reason for optimism.  The EPA has announced plans  to initiate a rulemaking to regulate a limited number of industrial PFAS discharges. It falls far short of what’s needed to truly tackle these forever chemicals, but it’s a move in the right direction that shows some regulators can act when needed. Polluted tap water is not and should not be a partisan issue; it affects everyone. And finally, it appears that the regulators and lawmakers with the power to address drinking water safety on a community-wide level are starting to listen. But far more resources are needed from the federal government to thoroughly address all forms and sources of drinking water contamination. The EPA also needs to  consider drinking water quality  as one of the metrics it uses to decide how to distribute its drinking water program funds more equitably, so the worst-affected areas receive the most help. The quality of U.S. drinking water remains uneven across America. For many, access to safe tap water has been an impossibility for too long. But with more funding, stronger federal safety standards and a greater focus on helping historically disadvantaged areas, the state of American drinking water can eventually be strong in every community. There are challenges when it comes to delivering safe drinking water to millions of families who currently don’t have it. But they can be solved when the public and our elected officials come together around a common purpose: the right of every American, regardless of race, region or income, to have clean water.

It reveals that when some Americans drink a glass of tap water, they&#x27;re also potentially getting a dose of industrial or agricultural contaminants linked to cancer, brain and nervous system damage, fertility problems, hormone disruption and other health harms. And those risks likely increase in underserved communities, particularly those with higher Black or Latino populations. EWG’s research finds that people living in such areas might have a greater collective risk of cancer from the contaminants in their drinking water supplies than people in other parts of the country. Why does this unacceptable situation persist? One reason is that there is not enough funding to help replace lead pipelines and clean up our drinking water. Another is that federal water safety standards aren’t keeping pace with the latest science on contaminants – some regulations haven’t been updated in more than 50 years, and the Environmental Protection Agency is not moving fast enough on new drinking water rules. Ambitious efforts to safeguard the water we drink must achieve that goal for every American. It’s easy to be pessimistic about whether that idea is realistic, given that Flint is in  its seventh year  of the lead catastrophe. Yet an increased focus by Congress on drinking water funding, the rising and necessary role of environmental equity, and firm commitments for improvements by those with the power to make them happen all provide reason to be hopeful.  A growing number of Democratic and Republican lawmakers are advocating for legislation that would significantly boost funding to improve the quality of drinking water and end long-running pollution problems. Such spending would be an important move toward correcting a historic wrong – the fact that marginalized and low-income communities have the least access to safe drinking water. A recent report  by the Environmental Policy Innovation Center that analyzed the EPA’s drinking water funding program from 2011 to 2020 found that drinking water systems serving smaller communities and communities with greater numbers of people of color were less likely to receive assistance through the program. And without the resources to improve water quality, their systems will continue to suffer. Flint, a majority-Black city of roughly 100,000 people, may be the most prominent of many recent examples of people suffering with dirty drinking water. This type of situation occurs when water systems don’t get the funds they need to replace harmful lead pipes. It happens when people living in these areas have no option other than to  buy filters  to achieve cleaner water, even though they might not be able to afford them. It happens when rural communities have no choice but to drink polluted water from wells fouled by industrial agriculture – because there are no resources that provide safe drinking water supplies. It happens when pollution emergencies occur and communities are told to use bottled water. But this is not a long-term solution. And bottled water can contain contaminants and costs hundreds of times more than tap water. This means these communities are the ones that suffer most from the harmful effects of consuming unsafe drinking water. Fixing the situation requires a new approach – ensuring that much-needed aid is prioritized for underserved areas, so all communities can benefit from safer water. Just because the scale of the problem is vast does not mean it can’t be solved. Newark, N.J., took almost five years to  replace 20,000 lead lines  following detection of high lead levels in the city’s drinking water supplies. But the work is almost done, and just because it requires time and money is no reason not to do it. Disadvantaged communities that have shouldered an unfair burden of some of the most-polluted drinking water in the country must finally get the help they need, and only a major federal funding boost can achieve community-level improvements. But achieving true water equity also requires stricter safety standards to ensure that drinking water supplies no longer have pollution levels harmful to human health. The EPA and states do have some standards in place to protect drinking water supplies, but these limits on specific pollutants are often too weak to make the water safe to drink. Even when the standards are sufficiently stringent, a lack of resources to enforce the limits means the water remains unsafe, or that drinking water systems can’t fund the upgrades necessary to clean their supplies. The federal  Safe Drinking Water Act  , or SDWA, has helped to improve U.S. water quality. Enacted in 1974 and updated in 1986 and 1996, it established EPA standards for some contaminants, such as arsenic, copper and lead. But progress on regulating pollutants has stalled instead of keeping up with current science. The last time the EPA set a new legal limit for a drinking water pollutant was in 2000, when the agency took steps to lower uranium levels in tap water. Since then, Americans have continued to suffer from widespread drinking water contamination, particularly from emerging contaminants. This inaction at the federal level continues to exempt from adequate regulation PFAS, hexavalent chromium and more than 160 other unregulated contaminants that pollute tap water. Millions of people are exposed to unsafe drinking water as a result. For some other chemicals, the EPA’s maximum contaminant levels, or MCLs – the upper limit on a pollutant legally allowed in drinking water – haven’t been updated in 50 years. Yet there is extensive scientific research to justify the agency’s pursuit of much more stringent MCLs. The legal federal standard for nitrate, for example, is based on a recommendation from 1962, even though studies support lowering the current MCL by several orders of magnitude to protect against the risk of cancer. Drinking water standards are often based too heavily on cost concerns and political considerations. That’s why EWG, focused solely on what’s necessary to protect public health within an adequate margin of safety, has  suggested stricter standards  for several contaminants that would truly protect public health. Here’s the well-kept secret about existing drinking water standards: Legal doesn’t necessarily mean safe. The vast majority of the nation’s drinking water supplies get a passing grade from federal and state regulatory agencies. But many of the 324 contaminants detected by local utilities’ tests are found at levels that may be legal under EPA’s SDWA standards or state regulations – though they far exceed levels authoritative scientific studies have found to pose health risks. Even for chemicals that are regulated, the legal limit is often hundreds of times higher than the health standards recommended by scientists and public health agencies. Too often, legal limits are based more on what can be achieved in terms of treatment costs, and less on public health. And water treatment facilities in many communities, especially in rural areas, are outdated, overloaded or underfunded, as urgently needed investments in water infrastructure get postponed year after year. But even here, there’s reason for optimism.  The EPA has announced plans  to initiate a rulemaking to regulate a limited number of industrial PFAS discharges. It falls far short of what’s needed to truly tackle these forever chemicals, but it’s a move in the right direction that shows some regulators can act when needed. Polluted tap water is not and should not be a partisan issue; it affects everyone. And finally, it appears that the regulators and lawmakers with the power to address drinking water safety on a community-wide level are starting to listen. But far more resources are needed from the federal government to thoroughly address all forms and sources of drinking water contamination. The EPA also needs to  consider drinking water quality  as one of the metrics it uses to decide how to distribute its drinking water program funds more equitably, so the worst-affected areas receive the most help. The quality of U.S. drinking water remains uneven across America. For many, access to safe tap water has been an impossibility for too long. But with more funding, stronger federal safety standards and a greater focus on helping historically disadvantaged areas, the state of American drinking water can eventually be strong in every community. There are challenges when it comes to delivering safe drinking water to millions of families who currently don’t have it. But they can be solved when the public and our elected officials come together around a common purpose: the right of every American, regardless of race, region or income, to have clean water.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Support NRDC’s tireless work to save endangered wildlife, protect our air and water, and stop polluters from worsening the climate crisis. Donate today and your tax-deductible gift will be 2X MATCHED! Lots of people think drinking bottled water is safer. Is it? Few questions confound health-conscious conservationists more than the first one a waiter might ask at a nice restaurant: bottled or tap? We know which is better for the environment. That's easy. Not only are millions of tons of plastic bottles clogging our landfills, but it takes 1.63 liters of water to make every liter of Dasani—and the company is doing it in drought-plagued California. But despite those harsh realities, public concerns about tap-water quality (and, let's face it, slick marketing) have caused bottled water sales to soar over the past couple of decades. Some of those concerns are merited: NRDC reports have shown that millions of people in the United States get their water from systems detecting lead. And other health-harming contaminants, such as PFAS, atrazine, and nitrates, have also been found to be common in drinking water supplies across parts of the country.  Nevertheless, just because a bottled water company produces ads and labels that connote purity, with images of pristine glaciers and crystal-clear mountain springs, doesn’t mean that’s what consumers are getting.  It's regulated by different agencies, with different missions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees the quality of water that comes out of your tap, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring the safety and truthful labeling of bottled water sold nationally. States are responsible for regulating water that is both packaged and sold within its borders (which is most of the market), but one in five states doesn't even bother. It's important to note that the federal government does not require bottled water to be safer than tap. In fact, just the opposite is true in many cases. Tap water in most big cities must be disinfected, filtered to remove pathogens, and tested for cryptosporidium and giardia viruses. Bottled water does not have to be. Both kinds of water are tested regularly for bacteria and most synthetic organic chemicals, but city tap is typically assessed much more frequently. For example, bottlers must test for coliform bacteria just once a week; city tap needs to be tested 100 or more times a month. Limits on chemical pollution for both categories are almost identical. The one place where bottled water might have the edge is in the case of lead; because many older homes have lead pipes, the EPA standard for tap water is less strict—one-third of the FDA's standard for lead in bottled water. In 1999, after a four-year review of the bottled-water industry and its safety standards, NRDC concluded that there is no assurance that bottled is cleaner or safer than tap water. In fact, an estimated 25 percent or more of water sold in a plastic bottle is really just tap water in a bottle—sometimes further treated, sometimes not. Of the 1,000 bottles tested, the majority proved to be relatively clean and pure. About 22 percent of the brands tested contained chemicals at levels above state health limits in at least one sample. If consumed over a long period of time, some of those contaminants could cause cancer or other health problems for people with weakened immune systems. Though it's mostly safe, tap might at times also present issues—especially if you live in a rural community with a higher likelihood of pesticide runoff contamination, or if you get your water from a private (unregulated) well or live in an older home. Under "right-to-know" provisions in the drinking water law, all tap suppliers must provide annual quality reports to their customers. You also can test your water yourself. Standard consumer test packages are available through large commercial labs at a relatively reasonable price. Call your state drinking-water program or the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for a list of contacts. Your water report will point out possible risks to health; fortunately, a home filter designed explicitly to strip contaminants will resolve most cases. If you want to take extra precautions, you should purchase filters certified by NSF International. These models are designed to filter out specific contaminants, so you can select one based on your needs. Even though both the federal government and most states have bottled-water safety programs, regulations don't adequately assure consumers of either purity or safety. A few state programs (for example, those in Massachusetts and New York) maintain lists of the sources, but not all do. Carefully check the label and even the cap; if it says "from a municipal source" or "from a community water system," this means it's derived from tap. If you don't find any information on the bottle, you can call the bottler or the program in your state or the state where it was packaged and ask about the source. Recent research suggests there might be cause for concern. Chemicals called phthalates, which are known to disrupt testosterone and other hormones, can leach from the container into the water over time. One study found that water that had been stored for 10 weeks in plastic and in glass bottles containing phthalates, suggesting that the chemicals could be coming from the plastic cap or liner. Although there are regulatory standards limiting phthalates in tap, there are no legal limits in bottled water; the industry waged a successful campaign opposing the FDA proposal to set a legal limit for these chemicals.

 Michelle Crouch, Tap water in the United States is some of the best in the world, and it must meet strict federal standards to ensure it’s safe to drink, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, while it’s generally safe for drinking, tap water is not sterile, and there are a few situations in which using water straight from the faucet could endanger your health, according to experts and a CDC report published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.   AARP Membership Join AARP for $12 for your first year when you sign up for Automatic Renewal. Get instant access to members-only products and hundreds of discounts, a free second membership, and a subscription to AARP The Magazine.  Join Now The risk is higher for older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Using water straight from the tap for those activities is a bad idea whether you have municipal water or get your water from a well because you could introduce a harmful pathogen into your body, says Rachel Noble, a microbiologist and professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. It’s best to use distilled water or boiled tap water for those purposes, the CDC says. Most tap water naturally contains low levels of microorganisms such as bacteria and amoebae, says Shanna Miko, an epidemic intelligence service officer with the waterborne disease prevention branch of the CDC. The water is safe to drink because those pathogens typically get killed by stomach acid, she says. But the pathogens can multiply if they’re inhaled or introduced to more vulnerable parts of your body such as your eyes or nasal passages, potentially causing serious or deadly infections. “Those are dark, moist places that don’t have the benefit of stomach acid to help neutralize these bugs,” Miko says. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText  }% %{ description }% Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT Pathogens found in tap water such as ﻿Pseudomonas, nontuberculous mycobacteria and ﻿Legionella account for a significant percentage of the 120,000 hospitalizations and 7,000 deaths due to waterborne diseases annually, according to the CDC. For contact lens wearers, a dangerous amoeba called ﻿Acanthamoeba that lurks in tap water can cause a severe type of eye infection that is difficult to treat and can even lead to blindness, the CDC says. Saline solution made for contact lenses is best to use for rinsing.

                     In addition, a small number of cases of brain-eating amoeba have been linked to nasal rinsing, neti pots or similar devices, according to the CDC. About a third of Americans don’t realize that tap water can contain bacteria or other living organisms, according to an August 2021 CDC survey conducted by Miko and her colleagues. Perhaps more concerning, many of those surveyed reported using tap water in risky ways: About 1 in 4 said they filled humidifiers or CPAP machines with tap water, 13 percent reported using tap water for nasal rinsing, and 9 percent said they use tap water for rinsing contact lenses. Adults age 55 and older were somewhat less likely to use tap water for those activities compared to younger people, the survey found. However, a significant percentage — 22 percent — still reported filling respiratory devices with tap water, potentially endangering their health. Miko says you can either boil tap water to sterilize it or buy distilled water for those medical uses. She notes that not all bottled or filtered water is sterile. Look for “distilled” or “sterile” on the label, she says. To sterilize tap water yourself, boil the water for at least one minute (three minutes at elevations above 6,500 feet) and then let it cool before you use it. “It’s just a simple extra step,” Miko says. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

 Michelle Crouch, Tap water in the United States is some of the best in the world, and it must meet strict federal standards to ensure it’s safe to drink, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, while it’s generally safe for drinking, tap water is not sterile, and there are a few situations in which using water straight from the faucet could endanger your health, according to experts and a CDC report published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.   AARP Membership Join AARP for $12 for your first year when you sign up for Automatic Renewal.

Using water straight from the tap for those activities is a bad idea whether you have municipal water or get your water from a well because you could introduce a harmful pathogen into your body, says Rachel Noble, a microbiologist and professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. It’s best to use distilled water or boiled tap water for those purposes, the CDC says. Most tap water naturally contains low levels of microorganisms such as bacteria and amoebae, says Shanna Miko, an epidemic intelligence service officer with the waterborne disease prevention branch of the CDC. The water is safe to drink because those pathogens typically get killed by stomach acid, she says.

Climate change is affecting everything from weather patterns to the quality of the water we drink at home.  According to the National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF), rising sea levels are causing saltwater to flow into the groundwater. Groundwater, along with surface water that flows from lakes, rivers, streams, and reservoirs, are the sources for tap water, so higher salinity levels could make the water too salty to drink. And this would be a big problem. In 1974, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to regulate the public drinking water supply and protect the health and well-being of Americans. The act and its subsequent amendments designate the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the regulator of the standards for the United States’ public water supply.  The EPA has a three-step method for setting standards for drinking water. First, the organization identifies contaminants found in water and at what levels those contaminants put public health at risk. It notes which contaminants will require further study and which need to be regulated. Currently, there are 90 contaminants regulated by the EPA. Next, the EPA sets a maximum contamination level goal (MCLG) for the contaminants it will be regulating, aiming to keep contamination levels below their determined risk thresholds, which are decided within a margin of safety. Lastly, the organization sets a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for known contaminants in the public water system and enforces these standards using the most effective and economical technology and treatments available. The EPA requires each region’s water supplier to deliver an annual Consumer Confidence Report that identifies the source and quality of your community’s drinking water. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have affirmed that drinking water in the U.S. is among the safest in the world.

             While we understand the existing skepticism surrounding drinking tap water, plastic water bottles contribute to a large part of the ocean's pollution. If you’re still hesitant about a tap-based water intake, you might be tempted to invest in pallets of plastic water bottles on sale at your local big-box retailer. But consider this: According to a report by Greenpeace, the U.S. recycles between 5% and 6% of plastics, with the rest ending up in landfills or worse, the ocean.  Filtering your tap water at home is a much better option. A whole-house water treatment and purification system will cost $2,050 on average, according to Home Advisor.  But you can get started for far less money by using a simpler point-of-use filtration system, like a faucet filter or water pitcher with a carbon filter, like those made from Brita and PUR. $28.39 at Amazon $34.98 at Amazon In the wake of the Flint, Michigan, water crisis, when high levels of lead were found in the public drinking water source, Brita and Pur faucet filters were distributed. When installed and maintained correctly — which includes replacing when necessary — the filters were successful in removing lead from contaminated water. $30 at Amazon Filtered water pitchers make it easier to keep cold, refreshing water on hand, rather than taking up room in your refrigerator with individual bottles. Riggs Eckelberry, founder and CEO of OriginClear, a company dedicated to the creation of clean water systems for businesses and communities, notes that aside from all the additional plastic waste, there is the risk of chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA) that can leach into the water if the bottles get hot, like when they are left out in the sun or in your car overnight.  Purchasing a natural spring water dispenser for your home with larger, refillable bottles may seem like a better idea, but Eckelberry warns that the energy required to purify the water, recycle the bottles, and ship them to you greatly expands your carbon footprint. Yelena Wheeler, a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) with a master’s in public health, says any form of home water filtration is worth the upfront cost. “Not only is [drinking filtered tap water] better for your health and the environment, it also will save you money in the long run as it reduces constant spending on water bottles.” Wheeler notes that the potential savings are “astronomical.”
In fact, Royal Waterworks, an environmental water services company, estimates the annual cost of filtered water to be between $250 and $300. That’s about 50% less than purchasing bottled water.  And, with a 15- to 25-year lifespan on a home water filtration system, the company calculates the cost savings over that same timeframe to be around $7,500.  $483.39 at The Home Depot If you make it a point to carry a water bottle with you to stay hydrated throughout the day, make it a filtered water bottle.  Brita claims its BB11 premium filtering water bottle can replace 1,800 plastic bottles of water each year. Lifestraw, known for its portable water filter that permits travelers and campers to source clean drinking water from streams and other sources, uses similar technology for in-home filtration.   $29.90 at Amazon $17.47 at Amazon Wheeler says, “Water is often sold by the bottle in many places internationally; however, when you are traveling with your filtered water bottle, you not only avoid having to buy these water bottles, you also help reduce your international footprint.”  Even if your travels keep you closer to home, such as a bike ride in your own neighborhood, she says, “A water bottle with a filter in place pretty much guarantees clean water everywhere that you venture.” Replace your usual plastic water with an insulated reusable one that will remain cold throughout your day. We get it. It’s easy to reach for a bottle of natural spring water at a gas station or convenience store, especially when you’re thirsty and away from home. As with all healthy habits, forming the habit of drinking tap water is easier when you keep a filtered water pitcher filled at all times. Have reusable water bottles on hand so that they’re ready to fill for hydration on-the-go.  Don’t repurpose a plastic water bottle that you buy at the store, though; they’re made from plastics that are good for single-use only.  Whether you use a glass water bottle, a stainless steel water bottle, or a BPA-free plastic water bottle, just be sure to keep them clean.  $20.71 at Amazon Wheeler offers a pro tip: Clean your bottles using apple cider vinegar. Pour some into a bottle, fill up the rest with water, and give it a shake. Then, let it sit overnight. The next day, Wheeler rinses it out and then refills it with water and a drop or two of lavender oil to rid the bottle of any lingering odor from the apple cider vinegar. “The vinegar does wonders to get out any mold that might be festering in small parts of the water bottle,” she explains. $17 at Amazon $29.90 at Amazon There are many types of water that you can and can not drink. Here are a few of them. As we’ve established, yes, this is safe to drink. Yes, this is safe to drink as long as the water is not heated in the bottle, but it contributes enormously to plastic waste. According to the Mayo Clinic, alkaline water does not offer any health benefits over plain water. The idea is that alkaline water adjusts pH levels in the body, but there just isn’t enough conclusive evidence. $29.96 at Amazon Naturally occurring, mineral water gets a boost from minerals like calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfate, and potassium, although amounts of these can vary. We need minerals in our diet, so these waters could have health benefits, but studies that clearly establish this are scarce. You can buy beverage bottles of it imported from Europe, although opt for the glass bottle variety.  $46.50 at Amazon It depends. If you’re drinking spring water that has been purified and/or regulated, drink on. The taste is delicious.  However, be wary of gathering your own from an untreated water source, which could be contaminated with waste or bacteria. Doing so can lead to diseases caused by Giardia and E.coli.  $28.49 at Amazon Sure, you can also drink distilled water, although it won’t taste very good since it’s been boiled into steam and re-cooled back into a liquid to remove all minerals and impurities. $14.50 at Mountain Valley Spring

Climate change is affecting everything from weather patterns to the quality of the water we drink at home.  According to the National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF), rising sea levels are causing saltwater to flow into the groundwater. Groundwater, along with surface water that flows from lakes, rivers, streams, and reservoirs, are the sources for tap water, so higher salinity levels could make the water too salty to drink. And this would be a big problem. In 1974, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to regulate the public drinking water supply and protect the health and well-being of Americans. The act and its subsequent amendments designate the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the regulator of the standards for the United States’ public water supply.  The EPA has a three-step method for setting standards for drinking water. First, the organization identifies contaminants found in water and at what levels those contaminants put public health at risk. It notes which contaminants will require further study and which need to be regulated. Currently, there are 90 contaminants regulated by the EPA. Next, the EPA sets a maximum contamination level goal (MCLG) for the contaminants it will be regulating, aiming to keep contamination levels below their determined risk thresholds, which are decided within a margin of safety. Lastly, the organization sets a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for known contaminants in the public water system and enforces these standards using the most effective and economical technology and treatments available. The EPA requires each region’s water supplier to deliver an annual Consumer Confidence Report that identifies the source and quality of your community’s drinking water. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have affirmed that drinking water in the U.S. is among the safest in the world.

             While we understand the existing skepticism surrounding drinking tap water, plastic water bottles contribute to a large part of the ocean&#x27;s pollution. If you’re still hesitant about a tap-based water intake, you might be tempted to invest in pallets of plastic water bottles on sale at your local big-box retailer. But consider this: According to a report by Greenpeace, the U.S. recycles between 5% and 6% of plastics, with the rest ending up in landfills or worse, the ocean.  Filtering your tap water at home is a much better option. A whole-house water treatment and purification system will cost $2,050 on average, according to Home Advisor.  But you can get started for far less money by using a simpler point-of-use filtration system, like a faucet filter or water pitcher with a carbon filter, like those made from Brita and PUR. $28.39 at Amazon $34.98 at Amazon In the wake of the Flint, Michigan, water crisis, when high levels of lead were found in the public drinking water source, Brita and Pur faucet filters were distributed. When installed and maintained correctly — which includes replacing when necessary — the filters were successful in removing lead from contaminated water. $30 at Amazon Filtered water pitchers make it easier to keep cold, refreshing water on hand, rather than taking up room in your refrigerator with individual bottles. Riggs Eckelberry, founder and CEO of OriginClear, a company dedicated to the creation of clean water systems for businesses and communities, notes that aside from all the additional plastic waste, there is the risk of chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA) that can leach into the water if the bottles get hot, like when they are left out in the sun or in your car overnight.  Purchasing a natural spring water dispenser for your home with larger, refillable bottles may seem like a better idea, but Eckelberry warns that the energy required to purify the water, recycle the bottles, and ship them to you greatly expands your carbon footprint. Yelena Wheeler, a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) with a master’s in public health, says any form of home water filtration is worth the upfront cost. “Not only is [drinking filtered tap water] better for your health and the environment, it also will save you money in the long run as it reduces constant spending on water bottles.” Wheeler notes that the potential savings are “astronomical.”
In fact, Royal Waterworks, an environmental water services company, estimates the annual cost of filtered water to be between $250 and $300. That’s about 50% less than purchasing bottled water.  And, with a 15- to 25-year lifespan on a home water filtration system, the company calculates the cost savings over that same timeframe to be around $7,500.  $483.39 at The Home Depot If you make it a point to carry a water bottle with you to stay hydrated throughout the day, make it a filtered water bottle.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Overview Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction. In 2010, the UN General Assembly explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation. Everyone has the right to sufficient, continuous, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use. Sustainable Development Goal target 6.1 calls for universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water. The target is tracked with the indicator of “safely managed drinking water services” – drinking water from an improved water source that is located on premises, available when needed, and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination. In 2022, 6 billion people used safely managed drinking-water services – that is, they used improved water sources located on premises, available when needed, and free from contamination. The remaining 2.2 billion people without safely managed services in 2022 included: Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks. This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both patients and staff are placed at additional risk of infection and disease when water, sanitation and hygiene services are lacking.  Out of every 100 patients in acute-care hospitals, 7 patients in high-income countries (HICs) and 15 patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will acquire at least one health care-associated infection during their hospital stay. Inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater means the drinking-water of hundreds of millions of people is dangerously contaminated or chemically polluted. Natural presence of chemicals, particularly in groundwater, can also be of health significance, including arsenic and fluoride, while other chemicals, such as lead, may be elevated in drinking-water as a result of leaching from water supply components in contact with drinking-water. Some 1 million people are estimated to die each year from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hand hygiene. Yet diarrhoea is largely preventable, and the deaths of 395 000 children aged under 5 years could be avoided each year if these risk factors were addressed. Where water is not readily available, people may decide handwashing is not a priority, thereby adding to the likelihood of diarrhoea and other diseases. Diarrhoea is the most widely known disease linked to contaminated food and water but there are other hazards. In 2021, over 251.4 million people required preventative treatment for schistosomiasis – an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms contracted through exposure to infested water. When water comes from improved and more accessible sources, people spend less time and effort physically collecting it, meaning they can be productive in other ways. This can also result in greater personal safety and reducing musculoskeletal disorders by reducing the need to make long or risky journeys to collect and carry water. Better water sources also mean less expenditure on health, as people are less likely to fall ill and incur medical costs and are better able to remain economically productive. With children particularly at risk from water-related diseases, access to improved sources of water can result in better health, and therefore better school attendance, with positive longer-term consequences for their lives. Historical rates of progress would need to double for the world to achieve universal coverage with basic drinking water services by 2030. To achieve universal safely managed services will require a 6-fold increase. Climate change, increasing water scarcity, population growth, demographic changes and urbanization already pose challenges for water supply systems. Over 2 billion people live in water-stressed countries, which is expected to be exacerbated in some regions as result of climate change and population growth. Re-use of wastewater to recover water, nutrients or energy is becoming an important strategy. Use of wastewater and sludge is widespread globally; however, much is used informally and/or without sufficient treatment and other controls to ensure that human and environmental health is protected. If done appropriately safe use of wastewater and sludge can yield multiple benefits, including increased food production, increased resilience to water and nutrient scarcity and greater circularity in the economy. Options for water sources used for drinking-water and irrigation will continue to evolve, with an increasing reliance on groundwater and alternative sources, including wastewater. Climate change will lead to greater fluctuations in harvested rainwater. Management of all water resources will need to be improved to ensure provision and quality. As the international authority on public health and water quality, WHO leads global efforts to prevent water-related disease, advising governments on the development of health-based targets and regulations. WHO produces a series of water quality guidelines, including on drinking-water, safe use of wastewater, and recreational water quality. The water quality guidelines are based on managing risks, and since 2004 the Guidelines for drinking-water quality promote the Framework for safe drinking-water. The Framework recommends establishment of health-based targets, the development and implementation of water safety plans by water suppliers to most effectively identify and manage risks from catchment to consumer, and independent surveillance to ensure that water safety plans are effective and health-based targets are being met.The drinking-water guidelines are supported by background publications that provide the technical basis for the Guidelines recommendations. WHO also supports countries to implement the drinking-water quality guidelines through the development of practical guidance materials and provision of direct country support. This includes the development of locally relevant drinking-water quality regulations aligned to the principles in the Guidelines, the development, implementation and auditing of water safety plans and strengthening of surveillance practices. Since 2014, WHO has been testing household water treatment products against WHO health-based performance criteria through the WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies. The aim of the scheme is to ensure that products protect users from the pathogens that cause diarrhoeal disease and to strengthen policy, regulatory and monitoring mechanisms at the national level to support appropriate targeting and consistent and correct use of such products. WHO works closely with UNICEF in a number of areas concerning water and health, including on water, sanitation, and hygiene in health care facilities. In 2015 the two agencies jointly developed WASH FIT (Water and Sanitation for Health Facility Improvement Tool), an adaptation of the water safety plan approach. WASH FIT aims to guide small, primary health care facilities in low- and middle-income settings through a continuous cycle of improvement through assessments, prioritization of risk, and definition of specific, targeted actions. A 2023 report describes practical steps that countries can take to improve water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities.   References     Related News Fact sheets

Here’s what the results mean for you. In Connecticut, a condo had lead in its drinking water at levels more than double what the federal government deems acceptable. At a church in North Carolina, the water was contaminated with extremely high levels of potentially toxic PFAS chemicals. The water flowing into a Texas home had both—and concerning amounts of arsenic, too. All three were among locations that had water tested as part of a nine-month investigation by Consumer Reports and the Guardian US news organization into the nation’s drinking water.  Since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, access to safe water for all Americans has been a stated U.S. government goal. Yet millions of people continue to face serious water quality problems because of contamination, deteriorating infrastructure, and inadequate treatment at water plants.  CR and the Guardian selected 120 people from around the U.S., out of a pool of more than 6,000 volunteers, to test for arsenic, lead, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), and other contaminants. The samples came from water systems that together service more than 19 million people. The study has some limitations: The quality of the water at one location on a single day doesn’t necessarily reflect the quality of the water supplied by an entire system or at other times. But the ambitious undertaking, with community water systems chosen by CR’s statisticians (PDF) from a representative mix of systems across the country, provides a unique view into some of the most significant challenges in America’s ongoing drinking water crisis. The challenges don’t stem from a technology problem. Filtration systems can cleanse water of contaminants. Yet they are not being used uniformly by community water systems. Indeed, almost every sample tested had measurable levels of PFAS, a group of compounds found in hundreds of household products. These chemicals are linked to learning delays in children, cancer, and other health problems. More than 35 percent exceeded a safety threshold that CR scientists and other health experts believe should be the maximum.  Yet many consumers have never heard of PFAS.  Hung Ng, a resident of Florida, N.Y., says he has long used home water filters, in part to remove lead. But the 69-year-old says he didn’t know anything about PFAS until he had his water tested as part of this investigation, which found comparatively high levels of the chemicals in his water.  “Now I’ve got to find something to filter out the PFAS,” Ng says. CR’s tests revealed other problems as well. About 8 percent of samples had levels of arsenic—which gets into drinking water through natural deposits or industrial or agricultural pollution—above CR’s recommended maximum for drinking water. And almost every sample had measurable amounts of lead, a heavy metal that leaches from corroding water lines and home plumbing fixtures. It is unsafe at any level. In response to CR’s findings, Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson Andrea Drinkard says that 93 percent of the population supplied by community water systems gets water that meets “all health-based standards all of the time” and that the agency has set standards for more than 90 contaminants. That includes arsenic and lead but does not include PFAS.  America’s water crisis, while widespread, affects some communities more than others, according to an analysis of more than 140,000 public water systems published by the Guardian in February. It found that access to clean drinking water is highly unequal in the U.S., with water systems that service poorer and rural counties far more likely to have violations than those that provide water to wealthier or urban ones. Water systems in counties with large Latino populations were particularly likely to have violations, the Guardian found. The PFAS results from CR’s tests are particularly troubling. Manufacturers use PFAS to make stain-resistant fabrics and carpets, water-repellent clothing, nonstick cookware, and hundreds of other common products. The compounds can seep into water from factories, landfills, and other sources. And because they don’t easily break down in the environment, they’re often called “forever chemicals.”  Investigation into the health effects of PFAS exposure is ongoing, but some of the strongest evidence about their potential risks comes from research of about 69,000 people in and around Parkersburg, W.Va. The research—part of a settlement between DuPont, which makes some PFAS, and residents of the community—was depicted in the 2019 movie “Dark Waters.”  It found a “probable link” between exposure to a type of PFAS and six health problems: high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and testicular and kidney cancers. Research has also linked some PFAS to learning delays in children. Most Americans have trace amounts of PFAS in their blood, according to research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And at least 2,337 communities in 49 states have drinking water known to be contaminated with PFAS, according to a January analysis by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), an advocacy organization. CR’s tests results confirm the ubiquity of the chemicals: We found PFAS in 117 of the 120 samples we tested, from locations across the country.  Despite mounting evidence of widespread contamination and health risks, the EPA has still not set an enforceable legal limit for PFAS in drinking water. Instead, it has established only voluntary limits, which apply to just two of the better-studied forever chemicals—PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS, or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid—at 70 parts per trillion combined. (For context, 1 ppt is the equivalent of one grain of sand in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, according to some estimates.)  Many public health experts think those levels are far too high. Harvard environmental health professor Philippe Grandjean, PhD, has suggested that the limit should be just 1 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, citing his 2013 research—partly funded by the EPA—showing decreased vaccine response in children exposed to the chemicals. The EWG supports that threshold for total PFAS, pointing to Grandjean’s work as well as other research linking PFAS to health problems in rodents.  CR’s chief scientific officer, James Dickerson, PhD, agrees that when it comes to PFAS, “the lower the better.” CR’s scientists say the maximum allowed amount should be 5 ppt for a single PFAS chemical and 10 ppt for two or more. That is in line with standards for bottled water that an industry group, the International Bottled Water Association, has its members adhere to. Among the 120 samples CR tested, more than a third had PFAS levels above 10 ppt, and more than a quarter exceeded 5 ppt for a single PFAS chemical. Two samples had PFAS levels above the federal advisory level of 70 ppt, with the highest amount—80.2 ppt—coming from a sample that Jim Vaughn, a 76-year-old retired electrical equipment salesman, collected at his church in Pittsboro, N.C.  Vaughn wasn’t particularly surprised, he says. Places such as Pittsboro—a community of about 6,700 on the fringes of North Carolina’s Research Triangle, which is anchored by three universities and filled with industry and high-tech business—are used to getting “dumped on,” he says.  “It’s that little feeling of helplessness. Is there something that the town will do about it? Or will we let it ride?” Indeed, residents of Pittsboro have reason to worry, beyond the results of CR’s tests. In 2007, an EPA study (PDF) found PFAS contamination in the Cape Fear River Basin, a major source of drinking water for the eastern half of North Carolina. Some of the highest levels came from the Haw River in the basin’s north end—where Pittsboro gets its water.  Ongoing research out of Duke University, in nearby Durham, has also raised concerns. It found that levels of PFAS in a study of 49 Pittsboro residents’ blood are two to four times higher than that of the general U.S. population. Heather Stapleton, PhD, the project’s lead investigator, says Vaughn’s test results align with her team’s findings.  Stapleton’s team found a striking similarity between the levels of PFAS in the blood of Pittsboro residents and residents of the cities of Wilmington and Fayetteville, downstream from Pittsboro, raising concerns that the drinking water in those communities could be contaminated with PFAS, too, she says.  “If you think about the number of communities that could be impacted, it’s close to a million people, or 10 percent of North Carolina’s population,” she says.  Chris Kennedy, town manager for Pittsboro, says the town was not a source of PFAS but that it was “diligently working towards removing PFAS from our potable water supply.” He adds that the town is installing filters at the water treatment plant to remove at least 90 percent of PFAS by the end of 2021 and is taking steps “to reduce contamination into the Haw River, which will provide the best results long term.” More than 1,200 miles away from Pittsboro, Sandy and Scott Phillips sat around their kitchen table in Texas on a weekday in February reflecting on the test results for their water samples.  Last year, looking to downsize, they built the custom home of their dreams in a new development in Round Rock, 20 miles north of Austin. Sandy Phillips especially enjoyed picking out everything from the floors to the kitchen cabinets. “We paid a little extra for the white cabinets because I just love the clean look,” she says.  What the couple didn’t get to pick was their tap water supplier. Soon after moving in, they began to notice the water had an unusual odor, prompting them to invest thousands in a water softening and reverse osmosis water filtration system. Not long after, the couple got their water tested as part of CR’s project, taking samples from water before it was filtered. The results were concerning: high not just in PFAS (32.8 ppt) but also in arsenic, at 3.3 parts per billion. “We get this gorgeous house,” Sandy Phillips says, “and then the water is terrible.”  Bill Brown, general manager of the Jonah Water Special Utility District, the couple’s water supplier, says it “has complied with all federal and state minimum contaminant level standards for arsenic and lead for many years.” He says that while CR’s results conflicted with its records, the water district will investigate. He did not comment on the PFAS found in the Phillipses’ water.  In the early 2000s, the EPA considered a drinking water limit for arsenic of 3 ppb, before settling on 10 ppb as an amount that balances the costs for water system operators while reducing health risks. CR scientists have long said the EPA should set a limit of 3 ppb or lower, in line with what other health experts and environmental advocacy groups, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), have called for. Almost every sample CR tested had measurable levels of arsenic, including 10—or about 8 percent—with levels between 3 and 10 ppb. Previous tests from CR and others have shown elevated levels in juices and baby foods.  Hundreds of water systems have exceeded the EPA’s 10-ppb limit. And though research indicates that the percentage of systems violating the rule has dropped over time, a 2017 NRDC study (PDF) found that more than 500 systems provided water with excessive arsenic to 1.8 million people in the U.S. in 2015. Research suggests that exposure to even low levels of arsenic can pose health risks over the long term. A 2014 study in the journal Environmental Health found an association between water with arsenic of 5 ppb or greater and a 5- to 6-point IQ reduction in children. Two states—New Hampshire and New Jersey—have lowered their arsenic limit to 5 ppb, citing warnings from studies. The EPA itself even sets its “maximum contaminant level goal”—the level below which there is no known or expected risk to health—at zero for arsenic. The Phillipses, in Texas, were especially fortunate to have installed a filtration system because the results of their unfiltered tap test showed high levels of not only arsenic but also lead, at 5.8 ppb. (CR’s follow-up tests of the couple’s filtered water showed trace amounts of lead and levels of arsenic and PFAS well within CR’s recommended limits.) The risks of lead, and problems with how water utilities test for it, became a national concern when news of the water crisis in Flint, Mich., exploded in 2015. Scientists and the EPA agree that there’s no safe exposure level of lead. But taking into consideration the feasibility of achieving lower levels, the EPA says utilities have to take significant steps to lower lead levels—including replacing lead service lines—only when 10 percent of samples from homes in their service areas exceed 15 ppb.  Consumer advocates say those EPA regulations are problematic—a reality underscored by the testing results of water being piped into a condo owned by Stephen and Robin Newberg in New Britain, Conn.  Lead typically works its way into drinking water through lead pipes that feed people’s homes or in the home’s plumbing itself. That underscores the need for more robust residential water testing, including samples from far more homes than currently required, experts say. While New Britain’s annual water quality report for customers indicates that its average lead level is 6 ppb, the Newbergs’ results showed a concentration of 31.2 ppb, more than double the EPA’s action level of 15 ppb.  Stephen Newberg, a former postal worker, says he drinks filtered water and his wife drinks bottled water, so he’s not personally worried. But the 66-year-old sits on the board of his condo, and he’s concerned about the possibility of the heavy metal being in his neighbors’ water. He plans to raise the issue at an upcoming meeting. The results caught him and his wife off guard: “The lead really did surprise us,” he says.  Ramon Esponda, New Britain’s deputy director of public works, says that the city complies with the EPA’s lead regulations, based on its 2020 tests, which found an average lead level of 2 ppb. Esponda says that results of a single sample may be thrown off by new fixtures, recent plumbing work, or other factors. After this article published, Esponda told CR the city retested the Newbergs’ water and found lead levels of 3 ppb. CR’s experts say lead levels are indeed known to vary, but the fact that the Newbergs’ earlier tests showed high levels remains concerning. The installation of new lead service lines—pipes that connect a water main in a street to individual buildings—was banned in 1986. But an estimated 3 million to 6 million homes and businesses nationwide still get water through older lines that contain lead, according to EPA estimates. An untold number of homes have plumbing fixtures made of the heavy metal. Exposure can especially pose risks in children, such as reduced IQ and behavioral problems.  The Newbergs’ results were the only ones in CR’s tests to be above the EPA action level. But almost every sample had measurable levels of lead, and health experts emphasize that no amount of lead is safe.  Erik Olson, senior strategic director of health and food at the NRDC, says the Newbergs’ results illustrate several problems with how the EPA regulates lead. One is that water systems may test for lead only once every three years, and smaller systems can get waivers to test every nine years. Another is that the sample sizes are generally small. “Even in a large city, they may only test 50 homes,” Olson says. Systems are supposed to test homes that have lead service lines or plumbing and fixtures, but that requirement is often skirted, too, he says. “There’s very little oversight, and they may not be testing the highest-risk homes.” CR’s Dickerson agrees that the EPA needs to require municipalities to take many more samples from taps inside homes, to better protect consumers.  The EPA, in the waning days of the Trump administration, finalized changes to the lead regulation that would require testing in elementary schools and established new rules regarding the steps water systems must take when lead is detected.  But the NRDC, the NAACP, and other groups recently sued the EPA, saying those steps didn’t go far enough, and urged the Biden administration to improve on them. In particular, the NRDC says, the revised rule would leave lead service lines in place for decades.  EPA spokesperson Drinkard, citing the pending litigation, says the agency has no additional information to share. People seeking cleaner drinking water do have some options for reducing their exposure to dangerous contaminants. (See "How to Test and Treat Your Drinking Water.") But consumer advocates say that fixing the problem shouldn’t be up to consumers.  “Americans shouldn’t have to navigate bureaucracy and be forced to make significant investments in order to access clean tap water,” says Brian Ronholm, CR’s director of food policy. “The implementation of strong standards would ensure everyone has access to clean water, regardless of income levels.”  Legislation passed last year by the House of Representatives would have authorized $22.5 billion to replace lead service lines across the U.S., according to the NRDC, but the bill died in the Senate. The NRDC called for the Biden administration and Congress to enact legislation requiring the expeditious removal and replacement of lead lines. “The only way to really solve the lead problem is to remove lead from the system,” Olson says. Congress is also focusing on PFAS. In January, a congressional task force urged the Biden administration to take immediate steps to address PFAS contamination by, among other things, directing the EPA to phase out any uses for the chemicals deemed “non-essential,” to finalize a standard for PFOA and PFOS, and to accelerate cleanup.  Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., a member of the task force, responded to the findings from CR’s tests, saying they show that “we do not have any time to waste as we battle these toxic chemicals.” She renewed her call for PFAS to be banned and designated as hazardous. “Congress must pass my PFAS Action Act and take other concrete action to protect our drinking water, our environment, and our public health,” Dingell says. CR agrees that a standard must be set as soon as possible. “The burden shouldn’t be on consumers to monitor contaminants in drinking water,” Ronholm says.  Pittsboro’s Jim Vaughn says that while government and industry debate, residents of his town are left with unsafe water. “The town that has the polluters in it, they’re getting their water from upstream, so what’s their impetus” to fix the problem, he says. “The ones downstream have no power over the ones upstream to force them to do that. I just don’t think it’s fair.” Consumer Reports teamed up with our members and readers of the Guardian US to investigate the nation’s drinking water. From a pool of more than 6,000 potential volunteers, CR statisticians winnowed the group to 120 people representing a cross section of the country and the water systems that service it. That included 12 samples from each of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 10 jurisdictional regions. Testers were chosen to provide a mix of urban and rural locations, as well as small and large water systems. We were particularly interested in PFAS, chemicals notorious for both their health risks and their perseverance in the environment.  Each participant received test kits for PFAS, as well as for arsenic, lead, and other contaminants, plus a video showing how to collect the samples. That included gathering samples of water before it went through any filter or treatment system that participants might have in their homes. When tests were complete, we sent volunteers advice tailored to their results. We can’t draw conclusions about any specific water system, because results from one location on a single day don’t necessarily reflect a system’s overall quality, but together the results provide powerful insights into problems faced by the nation as a whole. See test results for each location (PDF). “While much of CR’s testing is done in our labs with our scientists, projects like these need real people,” says James Dickerson, PhD, CR’s chief scientific officer. “We are grateful to the readers who helped and shared their stories with us.” Learn more about how you can participate in future projects.

That includes arsenic and lead but does not include PFAS.  America’s water crisis, while widespread, affects some communities more than others, according to an analysis of more than 140,000 public water systems published by the Guardian in February. It found that access to clean drinking water is highly unequal in the U.S., with water systems that service poorer and rural counties far more likely to have violations than those that provide water to wealthier or urban ones. Water systems in counties with large Latino populations were particularly likely to have violations, the Guardian found. The PFAS results from CR’s tests are particularly troubling. Manufacturers use PFAS to make stain-resistant fabrics and carpets, water-repellent clothing, nonstick cookware, and hundreds of other common products. The compounds can seep into water from factories, landfills, and other sources. And because they don’t easily break down in the environment, they’re often called “forever chemicals.”  Investigation into the health effects of PFAS exposure is ongoing, but some of the strongest evidence about their potential risks comes from research of about 69,000 people in and around Parkersburg, W.Va. The research—part of a settlement between DuPont, which makes some PFAS, and residents of the community—was depicted in the 2019 movie “Dark Waters.”  It found a “probable link” between exposure to a type of PFAS and six health problems: high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and testicular and kidney cancers. Research has also linked some PFAS to learning delays in children. Most Americans have trace amounts of PFAS in their blood, according to research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And at least 2,337 communities in 49 states have drinking water known to be contaminated with PFAS, according to a January analysis by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), an advocacy organization. CR’s tests results confirm the ubiquity of the chemicals: We found PFAS in 117 of the 120 samples we tested, from locations across the country.  Despite mounting evidence of widespread contamination and health risks, the EPA has still not set an enforceable legal limit for PFAS in drinking water. Instead, it has established only voluntary limits, which apply to just two of the better-studied forever chemicals—PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS, or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid—at 70 parts per trillion combined. (For context, 1 ppt is the equivalent of one grain of sand in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, according to some estimates.)  Many public health experts think those levels are far too high. Harvard environmental health professor Philippe Grandjean, PhD, has suggested that the limit should be just 1 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, citing his 2013 research—partly funded by the EPA—showing decreased vaccine response in children exposed to the chemicals. The EWG supports that threshold for total PFAS, pointing to Grandjean’s work as well as other research linking PFAS to health problems in rodents.  CR’s chief scientific officer, James Dickerson, PhD, agrees that when it comes to PFAS, “the lower the better.” CR’s scientists say the maximum allowed amount should be 5 ppt for a single PFAS chemical and 10 ppt for two or more. That is in line with standards for bottled water that an industry group, the International Bottled Water Association, has its members adhere to. Among the 120 samples CR tested, more than a third had PFAS levels above 10 ppt, and more than a quarter exceeded 5 ppt for a single PFAS chemical. Two samples had PFAS levels above the federal advisory level of 70 ppt, with the highest amount—80.2 ppt—coming from a sample that Jim Vaughn, a 76-year-old retired electrical equipment salesman, collected at his church in Pittsboro, N.C.  Vaughn wasn’t particularly surprised, he says. Places such as Pittsboro—a community of about 6,700 on the fringes of North Carolina’s Research Triangle, which is anchored by three universities and filled with industry and high-tech business—are used to getting “dumped on,” he says.  “It’s that little feeling of helplessness. Is there something that the town will do about it? Or will we let it ride?” Indeed, residents of Pittsboro have reason to worry, beyond the results of CR’s tests. In 2007, an EPA study (PDF) found PFAS contamination in the Cape Fear River Basin, a major source of drinking water for the eastern half of North Carolina. Some of the highest levels came from the Haw River in the basin’s north end—where Pittsboro gets its water.  Ongoing research out of Duke University, in nearby Durham, has also raised concerns. It found that levels of PFAS in a study of 49 Pittsboro residents’ blood are two to four times higher than that of the general U.S. population. Heather Stapleton, PhD, the project’s lead investigator, says Vaughn’s test results align with her team’s findings.  Stapleton’s team found a striking similarity between the levels of PFAS in the blood of Pittsboro residents and residents of the cities of Wilmington and Fayetteville, downstream from Pittsboro, raising concerns that the drinking water in those communities could be contaminated with PFAS, too, she says.  “If you think about the number of communities that could be impacted, it’s close to a million people, or 10 percent of North Carolina’s population,” she says.  Chris Kennedy, town manager for Pittsboro, says the town was not a source of PFAS but that it was “diligently working towards removing PFAS from our potable water supply.” He adds that the town is installing filters at the water treatment plant to remove at least 90 percent of PFAS by the end of 2021 and is taking steps “to reduce contamination into the Haw River, which will provide the best results long term.” More than 1,200 miles away from Pittsboro, Sandy and Scott Phillips sat around their kitchen table in Texas on a weekday in February reflecting on the test results for their water samples.  Last year, looking to downsize, they built the custom home of their dreams in a new development in Round Rock, 20 miles north of Austin. Sandy Phillips especially enjoyed picking out everything from the floors to the kitchen cabinets. “We paid a little extra for the white cabinets because I just love the clean look,” she says.  What the couple didn’t get to pick was their tap water supplier. Soon after moving in, they began to notice the water had an unusual odor, prompting them to invest thousands in a water softening and reverse osmosis water filtration system. Not long after, the couple got their water tested as part of CR’s project, taking samples from water before it was filtered. The results were concerning: high not just in PFAS (32.8 ppt) but also in arsenic, at 3.3 parts per billion. “We get this gorgeous house,” Sandy Phillips says, “and then the water is terrible.”  Bill Brown, general manager of the Jonah Water Special Utility District, the couple’s water supplier, says it “has complied with all federal and state minimum contaminant level standards for arsenic and lead for many years.” He says that while CR’s results conflicted with its records, the water district will investigate. He did not comment on the PFAS found in the Phillipses’ water.  In the early 2000s, the EPA considered a drinking water limit for arsenic of 3 ppb, before settling on 10 ppb as an amount that balances the costs for water system operators while reducing health risks. CR scientists have long said the EPA should set a limit of 3 ppb or lower, in line with what other health experts and environmental advocacy groups, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), have called for. Almost every sample CR tested had measurable levels of arsenic, including 10—or about 8 percent—with levels between 3 and 10 ppb. Previous tests from CR and others have shown elevated levels in juices and baby foods.  Hundreds of water systems have exceeded the EPA’s 10-ppb limit. And though research indicates that the percentage of systems violating the rule has dropped over time, a 2017 NRDC study (PDF) found that more than 500 systems provided water with excessive arsenic to 1.8 million people in the U.S. in 2015. Research suggests that exposure to even low levels of arsenic can pose health risks over the long term. A 2014 study in the journal Environmental Health found an association between water with arsenic of 5 ppb or greater and a 5- to 6-point IQ reduction in children. Two states—New Hampshire and New Jersey—have lowered their arsenic limit to 5 ppb, citing warnings from studies. The EPA itself even sets its “maximum contaminant level goal”—the level below which there is no known or expected risk to health—at zero for arsenic. The Phillipses, in Texas, were especially fortunate to have installed a filtration system because the results of their unfiltered tap test showed high levels of not only arsenic but also lead, at 5.8 ppb. (CR’s follow-up tests of the couple’s filtered water showed trace amounts of lead and levels of arsenic and PFAS well within CR’s recommended limits.) The risks of lead, and problems with how water utilities test for it, became a national concern when news of the water crisis in Flint, Mich., exploded in 2015. Scientists and the EPA agree that there’s no safe exposure level of lead. But taking into consideration the feasibility of achieving lower levels, the EPA says utilities have to take significant steps to lower lead levels—including replacing lead service lines—only when 10 percent of samples from homes in their service areas exceed 15 ppb.  Consumer advocates say those EPA regulations are problematic—a reality underscored by the testing results of water being piped into a condo owned by Stephen and Robin Newberg in New Britain, Conn.  Lead typically works its way into drinking water through lead pipes that feed people’s homes or in the home’s plumbing itself. That underscores the need for more robust residential water testing, including samples from far more homes than currently required, experts say. While New Britain’s annual water quality report for customers indicates that its average lead level is 6 ppb, the Newbergs’ results showed a concentration of 31.2 ppb, more than double the EPA’s action level of 15 ppb.  Stephen Newberg, a former postal worker, says he drinks filtered water and his wife drinks bottled water, so he’s not personally worried. But the 66-year-old sits on the board of his condo, and he’s concerned about the possibility of the heavy metal being in his neighbors’ water. He plans to raise the issue at an upcoming meeting. The results caught him and his wife off guard: “The lead really did surprise us,” he says.  Ramon Esponda, New Britain’s deputy director of public works, says that the city complies with the EPA’s lead regulations, based on its 2020 tests, which found an average lead level of 2 ppb. Esponda says that results of a single sample may be thrown off by new fixtures, recent plumbing work, or other factors. After this article published, Esponda told CR the city retested the Newbergs’ water and found lead levels of 3 ppb. CR’s experts say lead levels are indeed known to vary, but the fact that the Newbergs’ earlier tests showed high levels remains concerning. The installation of new lead service lines—pipes that connect a water main in a street to individual buildings—was banned in 1986. But an estimated 3 million to 6 million homes and businesses nationwide still get water through older lines that contain lead, according to EPA estimates. An untold number of homes have plumbing fixtures made of the heavy metal. Exposure can especially pose risks in children, such as reduced IQ and behavioral problems.  The Newbergs’ results were the only ones in CR’s tests to be above the EPA action level. But almost every sample had measurable levels of lead, and health experts emphasize that no amount of lead is safe.  Erik Olson, senior strategic director of health and food at the NRDC, says the Newbergs’ results illustrate several problems with how the EPA regulates lead. One is that water systems may test for lead only once every three years, and smaller systems can get waivers to test every nine years. Another is that the sample sizes are generally small. “Even in a large city, they may only test 50 homes,” Olson says. Systems are supposed to test homes that have lead service lines or plumbing and fixtures, but that requirement is often skirted, too, he says. “There’s very little oversight, and they may not be testing the highest-risk homes.” CR’s Dickerson agrees that the EPA needs to require municipalities to take many more samples from taps inside homes, to better protect consumers.  The EPA, in the waning days of the Trump administration, finalized changes to the lead regulation that would require testing in elementary schools and established new rules regarding the steps water systems must take when lead is detected.  But the NRDC, the NAACP, and other groups recently sued the EPA, saying those steps didn’t go far enough, and urged the Biden administration to improve on them. In particular, the NRDC says, the revised rule would leave lead service lines in place for decades.  EPA spokesperson Drinkard, citing the pending litigation, says the agency has no additional information to share. People seeking cleaner drinking water do have some options for reducing their exposure to dangerous contaminants. (See &quot;How to Test and Treat Your Drinking Water.&quot;) But consumer advocates say that fixing the problem shouldn’t be up to consumers.  “Americans shouldn’t have to navigate bureaucracy and be forced to make significant investments in order to access clean tap water,” says Brian Ronholm, CR’s director of food policy. “The implementation of strong standards would ensure everyone has access to clean water, regardless of income levels.”  Legislation passed last year by the House of Representatives would have authorized $22.5 billion to replace lead service lines across the U.S., according to the NRDC, but the bill died in the Senate. The NRDC called for the Biden administration and Congress to enact legislation requiring the expeditious removal and replacement of lead lines. “The only way to really solve the lead problem is to remove lead from the system,” Olson says. Congress is also focusing on PFAS. In January, a congressional task force urged the Biden administration to take immediate steps to address PFAS contamination by, among other things, directing the EPA to phase out any uses for the chemicals deemed “non-essential,” to finalize a standard for PFOA and PFOS, and to accelerate cleanup.  Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., a member of the task force, responded to the findings from CR’s tests, saying they show that “we do not have any time to waste as we battle these toxic chemicals.” She renewed her call for PFAS to be banned and designated as hazardous. “Congress must pass my PFAS Action Act and take other concrete action to protect our drinking water, our environment, and our public health,” Dingell says. CR agrees that a standard must be set as soon as possible. “The burden shouldn’t be on consumers to monitor contaminants in drinking water,” Ronholm says.  Pittsboro’s Jim Vaughn says that while government and industry debate, residents of his town are left with unsafe water. “The town that has the polluters in it, they’re getting their water from upstream, so what’s their impetus” to fix the problem, he says. “The ones downstream have no power over the ones upstream to force them to do that. I just don’t think it’s fair.” Consumer Reports teamed up with our members and readers of the Guardian US to investigate the nation’s drinking water. From a pool of more than 6,000 potential volunteers, CR statisticians winnowed the group to 120 people representing a cross section of the country and the water systems that service it. That included 12 samples from each of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 10 jurisdictional regions. Testers were chosen to provide a mix of urban and rural locations, as well as small and large water systems. We were particularly interested in PFAS, chemicals notorious for both their health risks and their perseverance in the environment.  Each participant received test kits for PFAS, as well as for arsenic, lead, and other contaminants, plus a video showing how to collect the samples. That included gathering samples of water before it went through any filter or treatment system that participants might have in their homes. When tests were complete, we sent volunteers advice tailored to their results. We can’t draw conclusions about any specific water system, because results from one location on a single day don’t necessarily reflect a system’s overall quality, but together the results provide powerful insights into problems faced by the nation as a whole. See test results for each location (PDF). “While much of CR’s testing is done in our labs with our scientists, projects like these need real people,” says James Dickerson, PhD, CR’s chief scientific officer. “We are grateful to the readers who helped and shared their stories with us.” Learn more about how you can participate in future projects.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: By Will Sheehan On April 25, 2019 In Cancer, Chemistry, Climate/Global Change, Environment/Sustainability, Global Health Have you ever questioned the quality of the water you drink every day? Or worried that cooking with tap water might be dangerous? For most of us, the answer to these questions is probably no. However, students from a Bass Connections team at Duke say we may want to think otherwise. From bottle refilling
stations to the tap, drinking water is so habitual and commonplace that we often
take it for granted. Only in moments of crisis do we start worrying about what’s
in the water we drink daily. The reality is that safe drinking water isn’t accessible
for a lot of people. Images like this hog farm motivated the Bass Connections project team DECIPHER to take a closer look at the quality of water in North Carolina. On April 16 they presented their concerning findings from three case studies looking at lead contamination, coal ash impoundments, and aging infrastructure at the Motorco Music Hall. Nadratun Chowdhury, a Ph.D. student in Civil and Environmental Engineering, investigated lead contamination in water. Lead is an abundant and corrosion-resistant material, making it appealing for use in things like paint, batteries, faucets and pipes. While we’ve successfully removed lead from paint and gasoline, a lot of old water pipes in use today are still fashioned from lead. That’s not good – lead is very toxic and can leach into the water. Just how toxic is it? Anything over a blood-lead level concentration of fifty parts per billion – fifty drops of water in a giant Olympic swimming pool – is considered dangerous. According to Duke graduate student Aaron Reuben, this much lead in one’s blood is correlated with downward social mobility, serious health concerns, diminished capacity to regulate thoughts and emotions, and hyperactivity. Lower income and minority areas are more at risk due to the higher likelihood of owning contaminated older homes.  Rupanjali Karthik, a Master of Laws student, conducted research on the intersection of water and aging infrastructure in Orange County. Breaks in water pipes are common and can result in serious consequences, like the loss of 9 million gallons of drinkable water. Sometimes it takes 8 or 9 months just to find the location of a broken pipe. In 2018, the UNC-Chapel Hill water main break caused a huge shortage on campus and at the medical center.  Excess fluoridation is also
an issue caused by aging infrastructure. In February 2017, a combination of
human and machine error caused an excessive fluoride concentration coming out
of an Orange County Water Treatment Plant. People were advised not to use their
water even to shower. A UNC basketball game had to move locations, and stores
were completely swept of bottled water.  Another issue is that arsenic, a known carcinogen, is often used as the fluoridation agent. We definitely don’t want that in our drinking water. Fluoridation isn’t even that necessary these days when we have toothpaste and mouthwash that supports our dental health.  Tommy Lin, an undergraduate
studying Chemistry and Computer Science, topped off the group’s presentation with
findings surrounding coal ash in Belmont, NC. Coal ash, the residue after coal
is burned in power plants, can pollute rivers and seep into ground water,
affecting domestic wells of neighboring communities. This creates a cocktail of
highly concentrated heavy metals and carcinogens. Drinking it can cause damage
to your nervous system, cancer, and birth defects, among other things. Not so great. Forty-five plastic water bottles.
That’s how much water it takes Laura, a Belmont resident, to cook her middle-sized
family Thanksgiving. She knows that number because it’s been her family’s
tradition the past three years. The Allen Plant Steam Station is a big culprit
of polluting water with coal ash. Tons of homes nearby the station, like Laura’s,
are told not to use the tap water. You can find these homes excessively
stockpiled with cases on cases of plastic water bottles.  These issues aren’t that apparent to people unless they have been directly impacted. Lead, aging infrastructure, and coal ash all pose real threats but are also very invisible problems. Kathleen Burns, a Ph.D. student in English, notes that only in moments of crisis will people start to care, but by then it may be too late. So, what can people do? Not much, according to the Bass Connections team. They noted that providing clean water is very much a structural issue which will require some complex steps to be solved. So, for now, you may want to go buy a Brita.  Previous Next Subscribe to our biweekly email newsletter to get research content delivered to your inbox 21 times per year!
