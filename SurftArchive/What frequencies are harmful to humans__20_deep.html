Electromagnetic radiation consists of waves of electric and magnetic energy moving together (i.e., radiating) through space at the speed of light.  Taken together, all forms of electromagnetic energy are referred to as the electromagnetic "spectrum."  Radio waves and microwaves emitted by transmitting antennas are one form of electromagnetic energy.  They are collectively referred to as "radiofrequency" or "RF" energy or radiation.  Note that the term “radiation” does not mean “radioactive.”  Often, the terms "electromagnetic field" or "radiofrequency field" are used to indicate the presence of electromagnetic or RF energy. The RF waves emanating from an antenna are generated by the movement of electrical charges in the antenna.  Electromagnetic waves can be characterized by a wavelength and a frequency.  The wavelength is the distance covered by one complete cycle of the electromagnetic wave, while the frequency is the number of electromagnetic waves passing a given point in one second.  The frequency of an RF signal is usually expressed in terms of a unit called the "hertz" (abbreviated "Hz").  One Hz equals one cycle per second.  One megahertz MHz equals one million cycles per second. Different forms of electromagnetic energy are categorized by their wavelengths and frequencies.  The RF part of the electromagnetic spectrum is generally defined as that part of the spectrum where electromagnetic waves have frequencies in the range of about 3 kilohertz (3 kHz) to 300 gigahertz (300 GHz).  Microwaves are a specific category of radio waves that can be loosely defined as radiofrequency energy at frequencies ranging from about 1 GHz to 30 GHz. (Back to Index) WHAT IS NON-IONIZING RADIATION? "Ionization" is a process by which electrons are stripped from atoms and molecules.  This process can produce molecular changes that can lead to damage in biological tissue, including effects on DNA, the genetic material of living organisms.  This process requires interaction with high levels of electromagnetic energy.  Those types of electromagnetic radiation with enough energy to ionize biological material include X-radiation and gamma radiation.  Therefore, X-rays and gamma rays are examples of ionizing radiation. The energy levels associated with RF and microwave radiation, on the other hand, are not great enough to cause the ionization of atoms and molecules, and RF energy is, therefore, is a type of non-ionizing radiation.  Other types of non-ionizing radiation include visible and infrared light.  Often the term "radiation" is used, colloquially, to imply that ionizing radiation (radioactivity), such as that associated with nuclear power plants, is present.  Ionizing radiation should not be confused with the lower-energy, non-ionizing radiation with respect to possible biological effects, since the mechanisms of action are quite different. (Back to Index) HOW IS RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY USED?  The most important use for RF energy is in providing telecommunications services.  Radio and television broadcasting, cellular telephones, personal communications services (PCS), pagers, cordless telephones, business radio, radio communications for police and fire departments, amateur radio, microwave point-to-point links and satellite communications are just a few of the many telecommunications applications of RF energy.  Microwave ovens are an example of a non-telecommunication use of RF energy.  Radiofrequency radiation, especially at microwave frequencies, can transfer energy to water molecules.  High levels of microwave energy will generate heat in water-rich materials such as most foods.  This efficient absorption of microwave energy via water molecules results in rapid heating throughout an object, thus allowing food to be cooked more quickly in a microwave oven than in a conventional oven.  Other important non-telecommunication uses of RF energy include radar and industrial heating and sealing.  Radar is a valuable tool used in many applications range from traffic speed enforcement to air traffic control and military surveillance.  Industrial heaters and sealers generate intense levels of RF radiation that rapidly heats the material being processed in the same way that a microwave oven cooks food.  These devices have many uses in industry, including molding plastic materials, gluing wood products, sealing items such as shoes and pocketbooks, and processing food products.  There are also a number of medical applications of RF energy, such as diathermy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (Back to Index) HOW IS RADIOFREQUENCY RADIATION MEASURED?  An RF electromagnetic wave has both an electric and a magnetic component (electric field and magnetic field), and it is often convenient to express the intensity of the RF environment at a given location in terms of units specific to each component. For example, the unit "volts per meter" (V/m) is used to express the strength of the electric field (electric "field strength"), and the unit "amperes per meter" (A/m) is used to express the strength of the magnetic field (magnetic "field strength").  Another commonly used unit for characterizing the total electromagnetic field is "power density."  Power density is most appropriately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from an antenna to be located in the "far-field" zone of the antenna. Power density is defined as power flow per unit area.  For example, power density is commonly expressed in terms of watts per square meter (W/m2), milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2), or microwatts per square centimeter (µW/cm2).  One mW/cm2 equals 10 W/m2, and 100 µW/cm2 equal one W/m2. With respect to frequencies in the microwave range, power density is usually used to express intensity of exposure. The quantity used to measure the rate at which RF energy is actually absorbed in a body is called the "Specific Absorption Rate" or "SAR."  It is usually expressed in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg) or milliwatts per gram (mW/g).  In the case of exposure of the whole body, a standing ungrounded human adult absorbs RF energy at a maximum rate when the frequency of the RF radiation is in the range of about 70 MHz.  This means that the "whole-body" SAR is at a maximum under these conditions.  Because of this "resonance" phenomenon and consideration of children and grounded adults, RF safety standards are generally most restrictive in the frequency range of about 30 to 300 MHz.  For exposure of parts of the body, such as the exposure from hand-held mobile phones, "partial-body" SAR limits are used in the safety standards to control absorption of RF energy (see later questions on mobile phones).  (Back to Index) WHAT BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS CAN BE CAUSED BY RF ENERGY?  Biological effects can result from exposure to RF energy.  Biological effects that result from heating of tissue by RF energy are often referred to as "thermal" effects.  It has been known for many years that exposure to very high levels of RF radiation can be harmful due to the ability of RF energy to heat biological tissue rapidly.  This is the principle by which microwave ovens cook food.  Exposure to very high RF intensities can result in heating of biological tissue and an increase in body temperature.  Tissue damage in humans could occur during exposure to high RF levels because of the body's inability to cope with or dissipate the excessive heat that could be generated.  Two areas of the body, the eyes and the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because of the relative lack of available blood flow to dissipate the excess heat load. At relatively low levels of exposure to RF radiation, i.e., levels lower than those that would produce significant heating, the evidence for production of harmful biological effects is ambiguous and unproven.  Such effects, if they exist, have been referred to as "non-thermal" effects.  A number of reports have appeared in the scientific literature describing the observation of a range of biological effects resulting from exposure to low levels of RF energy.  However, in most cases, further experimental research has been unable to reproduce these effects.  Furthermore, since much of the research is not done on whole bodies (in vivo), there has been no determination that such effects constitute a human health hazard.  It is generally agreed that further research is needed to determine the generality of such effects and their possible relevance, if any, to human health.  In the meantime, standards-setting organizations and government agencies continue to monitor the latest experimental findings to confirm their validity and determine whether changes in safety limits are needed to protect human health. (Back to Index) CAN PEOPLE BE EXPOSED TO LEVELS OF RADIOFREQUENCY RADIATION THAT COULD BE HARMFUL?  Studies have shown that environmental levels of RF energy routinely encountered by the general public are typically far below levels necessary to produce significant heating and increased body temperature.  However, there may be situations, particularly in workplace environments near high-powered RF sources, where the recommended limits for safe exposure of human beings to RF energy could be exceeded.  In such cases, restrictive measures or mitigation actions may be necessary to ensure the safe use of RF energy. (Back to Index) CAN RADIOFREQUENCY RADIATION CAUSE CANCER?  Some studies have also examined the possibility of a link between RF exposure and cancer.  Results to date have been inconclusive.  While some experimental data have suggested a possible link between exposure and tumor formation in animals exposed under certain specific conditions, the results have not been independently replicated.  Many other studies have failed to find evidence for a link to cancer or any related condition.  The Food and Drug Administration has further information on this topic with respect to RF exposure from mobile phones at the following Web site: FDA Radiation-Emitting Products Page . (Back to Index) WHAT RESEARCH IS BEING DONE ON RF BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS? For many years, research into the possible biological effects of RF energy has been carried out in laboratories around the world, and such research is continuing.  Past research has resulted in a large number of peer-reviewed scientific publications on this topic.  For many years the U.S. Government has sponsored research into the biological effects of RF energy.  The majority of this work was initiated by the Department of Defense, due in part, to the extensive military interest in using RF equipment such as radar and other relatively high-powered radio transmitters for routine military operations.  In addition, some U.S. civilian federal agencies responsible for health and safety, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have sponsored and conducted research in this area.  At the present time, other U.S. civilian federal health and safety agencies and institutions, such as the National Toxicology Program and the National Institutes of Health, have also initiated RF bioeffects research. In 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a program called the International EMF Project, which is designed to review the scientific literature concerning biological effects of electromagnetic fields, identify gaps in knowledge about such effects, recommend research needs, and work towards international resolution of health concerns over the use of RF technology.  The WHO maintains a Web site that provides extensive information on this project and about RF biological effects and research (www.who.int/peh-emf/en/). The FDA, the EPA and other federal agencies responsible for public health and safety have worked together and in connection with the WHO to monitor developments and identify research needs related to RF biological effects.  More information about this can be obtained at the FDA Web site: FDA Radiation-Emitting Products - Current Research. (Back to Index) WHAT LEVELS ARE SAFE FOR EXPOSURE TO RF ENERGY?  Exposure standards for radiofrequency energy have been developed by various organizations and governments.  Most modern standards recommend safe levels of exposure separately for the general public and for workers.  In the United States, the FCC has adopted and used recognized safety guidelines for evaluating RF environmental exposure since 1985.  Federal health and safety agencies, such as the EPA, FDA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have also been involved in monitoring and investigating issues related to RF exposure. The FCC guidelines for human exposure to RF electromagnetic fields were derived from the recommendations of two expert organizations, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  Both the NCRP exposure criteria and the IEEE standard were developed by expert scientists and engineers after extensive reviews of the scientific literature related to RF biological effects.  The exposure guidelines are based on thresholds for known adverse effects, and they incorporate prudent margins of safety.  In adopting the current RF exposure guidelines, the FCC consulted with the EPA, FDA, OSHA and NIOSH, and obtained their support for the guidelines that the FCC is using. Many countries in Europe and elsewhere use exposure guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).  The ICNIRP safety limits are generally similar to those of the NCRP and IEEE, with a few exceptions.  For example, ICNIRP recommends somewhat different exposure levels in the lower and upper frequency ranges and for localized exposure due to such devices as hand-held cellular telephones.  One of the goals of the WHO EMF Project (see above) is to provide a framework for international harmonization of RF safety standards.  The NCRP, IEEE and ICNIRP exposure guidelines identify the same threshold level at which harmful biological effects may occur, and the values for Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) recommended for electric and magnetic field strength and power density in both documents are based on this level.  The threshold level is a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value for the whole body of 4 watts per kilogram (4 W/kg).   In addition, the NCRP, IEEE and ICNIRP guidelines for maximum permissible exposure are different for different transmitting frequencies.  This is due to the finding (discussed above) that whole-body human absorption of RF energy varies with the frequency of the RF signal.  The most restrictive limits on whole-body exposure are in the frequency range of 30-300 MHz where the human body absorbs RF energy most efficiently when the whole body is exposed.  For devices that expose only part of the body, such as mobile phones, different exposure limits are specified (see below), but these limits are based on the same underlying threshold level. The exposure limits used by the FCC are expressed in terms of SAR, electric and magnetic field strength and power density for transmitters operating at frequencies from 100 kHz to 100 GHz.  The applicable limits depend upon the type of sources (e.g, whether a cellphone or a broadcast transmitting antenna). The actual values can be found in our informational bulletin available in OET Bulletin 65. (Back to Index) WHY HAS THE FCC ADOPTED GUIDELINES FOR RF EXPOSURE? The FCC authorizes and licenses devices, transmitters and facilities that generate RF radiation.  It has jurisdiction over all transmitting services in the U.S. except those specifically operated by the Federal Government.  However, the FCC's primary jurisdiction does not lie in the health and safety area, and it must rely on other agencies and organizations for guidance in these matters. Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), all Federal agencies are required to implement procedures to make environmental consideration a necessary part of an agency's decision-making process.  Therefore, FCC approval and licensing of transmitters and facilities must be evaluated for significant impact on the environment.  Human exposure to RF radiation emitted by FCC-regulated transmitters is one of several factors that must be considered in such environmental evaluations.  In 1996, the FCC revised its guidelines for RF exposure as a result of a multi-year proceeding and as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Facilities under the jurisdiction of the FCC having a high potential for creating significant RF exposure to humans, such as radio and television broadcast stations, satellite-earth stations, experimental radio stations and certain cellular, PCS and paging facilities are required to undergo routine evaluation for compliance with RF exposure guidelines whenever an application is submitted to the FCC for construction or modification of a transmitting facility or renewal of a license.  Failure to show compliance with the FCC's RF exposure guidelines in the application process could lead to the preparation of a formal Environmental Assessment, possible Environmental Impact Statement and eventual rejection of an application.  Technical guidelines for evaluating compliance with the FCC RF safety requirements can be found in the FCC's OET Bulletin 65 (see "OET Safety Bulletins" listing elsewhere at this Web site). Low-powered, intermittent, or inaccessible RF antennas and facilities (including many cell sites) are normally "categorically excluded" from the requirement of routine evaluation for RF exposure.  These exclusions are based on calculations and measurement data indicating that such transmitting stations or devices are unlikely to cause exposures in excess of the guidelines under normal conditions of use.  The FCC's policies on RF exposure and categorical exclusion can be found in Section 1.1307(b) of the FCC's Rules and Regulations [47 CFR 1.1307(b)].  It should be emphasized, however, that these exclusions are not exclusions from compliance, but, rather, only exclusions from routine evaluation.  Transmitters or facilities that are otherwise categorically excluded from evaluation may be required, on a case-by-case basis, to demonstrate compliance when evidence of potential non-compliance of the transmitter or facility is brought to the Commission's attention [see 47 CFR 1.1307(c) and (d)]. (Back to Index) HOW SAFE ARE MOBILE AND PORTABLE PHONES? In recent years, publicity, speculation, and concern over claims of possible health effects due to RF emissions from hand-held wireless telephones prompted various research programs to investigate whether there is any risk to users of these devices  There is no scientific evidence to date that proves that wireless phone usage can lead to cancer or a variety of other health effects, including headaches, dizziness or memory loss.  However, studies are ongoing and key government agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continue to monitor the results of the latest scientific research on these topics.  Also, as noted above, the World Health Organization has established an ongoing program to monitor research in this area and make recommendations related to the safety of mobile phones. The FDA, which has primary jurisdiction for investigating mobile phone safety, has stated that it cannot rule out the possibility of risk, but if such a risk exists, "it is probably small."  Further, it has stated that, while there is no proof that cellular telephones can be harmful, concerned individuals can take various precautionary actions, including limiting conversations on hand-held cellular telephones and making greater use of telephones with hands-free kits where there is a greater separation distance between the user and the radiating antenna.  The Web site for the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health provides further information on mobile phone safety: FDA Radiation-Emitting Products - Cell Phones. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) prepared a report of its investigation into safety concerns related to mobile phones.  The report concluded that further research is needed to confirm whether mobile phones are completely safe for the user, and the report recommended that the FDA take the lead in monitoring the latest research results. The FCC's exposure guidelines specify limits for human exposure to RF emissions from hand-held mobile phones in terms of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), a measure of the rate of absorption of RF energy by the body.  The safe limit for a mobile phone user is an SAR of 1.6 watts per kg (1.6 W/kg), averaged over one gram of tissue, and compliance with this limit must be demonstrated before FCC approval is granted for marketing of a phone in the United States.  Somewhat less restrictive limits, e.g., 2 W/kg averaged over 10 grams of tissue, are specified by the ICNIRP guidelines used in Europe and most other countries. Measurements and analysis of SAR in models of the human head have shown that the 1.6 W/kg limit is unlikely to be exceeded under normal conditions of use of cellular and PCS hand-held phones.  The same can be said for cordless telephones used in the home.  Testing of hand-held phones is normally done under conditions of maximum power usage, thus providing an additional margin of safety, since most phone usage is not at maximum power.  Information on SAR levels for many phones is available electronically through the FCC's Web site and database (see next question). (Back to Index) HOW CAN I OBTAIN THE SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE (SAR) VALUE FOR MY MOBILE PHONE?  As explained above, the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR, is the unit used to determine compliance of cellular and PCS phones with safety limits adopted by the FCC.  The SAR is a value that corresponds to the rate at which RF energy absorbed in the head of a user of a wireless handset.  The FCC requires mobile phone manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (averaged over one gram of tissue). Information on SAR for a specific cell phone model can be obtained for almost all cellular telephones by using the FCC identification (ID) number for that model.  The FCC ID number is usually printed somewhere on the case of the phone or device.  In many cases, you will have to remove the battery pack to find the number.  Once you have the number proceed as follows. Go to the following website: Equipment Authorization. Click on the link for “FCC ID Search”.  Once you are there you will see instructions for inserting the FCC ID number.  Enter the FCC ID number (in two parts as indicated: "Grantee Code" is comprised of the first three characters, the "Equipment Product Code" is the remainder of the FCC ID).  Then click on "Start Search."  Grant(s) of Equipment Authorization for this particular FCC ID number should then be available.  Click on a check under "Display Grant" and the grant should appear.  Look through the Grant for the section on SAR compliance, certification of compliance with FCC rules for RF exposure, or similar language.  This section should contain the value(s) for typical or maximum SAR for your phone. For portable phones and devices authorized since June 2, 2000, maximum SAR levels should be noted on the grant of equipment authorization.  For phones and devices authorized between about mid-1998 and June 2000, detailed information on SAR levels is typically found in one of the "exhibits" associated with the grant.  Therefore, once the grant is accessed in the FCC database, the exhibits can be viewed by clicking on the appropriate entry labeled "View Exhibit."  Electronic records for FCC equipment authorization grants were initiated in 1998, so devices manufactured prior to this date may not be included in our electronic database. Although the FCC database does not list phones by model number, there are certain non-government Web sites such as www.cnet.com, that provide information on SAR from specific models of mobile phones.  However, the FCC has not reviewed these sites for accuracy and makes no guarantees with respect to them.  In addition to these sites, some mobile phone manufacturers make this information available at their own Web sites.  Also, phones certified by the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association (CTIA) are now required to provide this information to consumers in the instructional materials that come with the phones. If you want additional consumer information on safety of cell phones and other transmitting devices please consult the information available below.

(Back to Index) DO "HANDS-FREE" EAR PIECES FOR MOBILE PHONES REDUCE EXPOSURE TO RF EMISSIONS?  WHAT ABOUT MOBILE PHONE ACCESSORIES THAT CLAIM TO SHIELD THE HEAD FROM RF RADIATION?  "Hands-free" kits with ear pieces can be used with cell phones for convenience and comfort.  In addition, because the phone, which is the source of the RF emissions, will not be placed against the head, absorption of RF energy in the head will be reduced.  Therefore, it is true that use of an ear piece connected to a mobile phone will significantly reduce the rate of energy absorption (or "SAR") in the user's head.  On the other hand, if the phone is mounted against the waist or other part of the body during use, then that part of the body will absorb RF energy.  Even so, mobile phones marketed in the U.S. are required to meet safety limit requirements regardless of whether they are used against the head or against the body.  So either configuration should result in compliance with the safety limit.  Note that hands-free devices using Bluetooth technology also include a wireless transmitter; however, the Bluetooth transmitter operates at a much lower power than the cell phone.  A number of devices have been marketed that claim to "shield" or otherwise reduce RF absorption in the body of the user.  Some of these devices incorporate shielded phone cases, while others involve nothing more than a metallic accessory attached to the phone.  Studies have shown that these devices generally do not work as advertised.  In fact, they may actually increase RF absorption in the head due to their potential to interfere with proper operation of the phone, thus forcing it to increase power to compensate.  The Federal Trade Commission has published a Consumer Alert regarding these shields on its website at: FTC Consumer Information - Cell Phone Radiation Scam. (Back to Index) CAN MOBILE PHONES BE USED SAFELY IN HOSPITALS AND NEAR MEDICAL TELEMETRY EQUIPMENT? The FCC does not normally investigate problems of electromagnetic interference from RF transmitters to medical devices.  Some hospitals have policies, which limit the use of cell phones, due to concerns that sensitive medical equipment could be affected.  The FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has primary jurisdiction for medical device regulation.  FDA staff has monitored this potential problem and more information is available from the CDRH Web site: http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts. (Back to Index) ARE WIRELESS CELLULAR AND PCS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS SAFE?  Cellular wireless radio services transmit using frequencies between 824 and 894 megahertz (MHz).  Transmitters in the Personal Communications Service (PCS) use frequencies in the range of 1850-1990 MHz.  More recently, advanced wireless services have been or are being introduced that transmit at frequencies in the 600, 700, 800, 1695-1780, 1915-1920, 1995-2020, 2110-2200 MHz spectrum ranges. Antennas used for cellular and PCS transmissions are typically located on towers, water tanks or other elevated structures including rooftops and the sides of buildings.  The combination of antennas and associated electronic equipment is referred to as a cellular or PCS "base station" or "cell site."  Typical heights for free-standing base station towers or structures are 50-200 feet.  A cellular base station may utilize several "omni-directional" antennas that look like poles, 10 to 15 feet in length, although these types of antennas are less common in urbanized areas. In urban and suburban areas, cellular and PCS service providers commonly use "sector" antennas for their base stations.  These antennas are rectangular panels, e.g., about 1 by 4 feet in size, typically mounted on a rooftop or other structure, but they are also mounted on towers or poles.  Panel antennas are usually arranged in three groups of three each.  It is common that not all antennas are used for the transmission of RF energy; some antennas may be receive-only. At a given cell site, the total RF power that could be radiated by the antennas depends on the number of radio channels (transmitters) installed, the power of each transmitter, and the type of antenna.  While it is theoretically possible for cell sites to radiate at very high power levels, the maximum power radiated in any direction usually does not exceed 500 watts.  The RF emissions from cellular or PCS base station antennas are generally directed toward the horizon in a relatively narrow pattern in the vertical plane.  In the case of sector (panel) antennas, the pattern is fan-shaped, like a wedge cut from a pie.  As with all forms of electromagnetic energy, the power density from the antenna decreases rapidly as one moves away from the antenna.  Consequently, ground-level exposures are much less than exposures if one were at the same height and directly in front of the antenna. Measurements made near typical cellular and PCS installations, especially those with tower-mounted antennas, have shown that ground-level power densities are hundreds to thousands of times less than the FCC's limits for safe exposure.   This makes it extremely unlikely that a member of the general public could be exposed to RF levels in excess of FCC guidelines due solely to cellular or PCS base station antennas located on towers or monopoles. When cellular and PCS antennas are mounted at rooftop locations it is possible that a person could encounter RF levels greater than those typically encountered on the ground.  However, once again, exposures approaching or exceeding the safety guidelines are only likely to be encountered very close to and directly in front of the antennas.  For sector-type antennas, RF levels to rear are usually very low. (Back to Index) For further information on cellular services go to https://www.fcc.gov/general/cellular-service. ARE CELLULAR AND OTHER RADIO TOWERS LOCATED NEAR HOMES OR SCHOOLS SAFE FOR RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS?  As discussed above, radiofrequency emissions from antennas used for cellular and PCS transmissions result in exposure levels on the ground that are typically thousands of times below safety limits.  These safety limits were adopted by the FCC based on the recommendations of expert organizations and endorsed by agencies of the Federal Government responsible for health and safety.  Therefore, there is no reason to believe that such towers could constitute a potential health hazard to nearby residents or students. Other antennas, such as those used for radio and television broadcast transmissions, use power levels that are generally much higher than those used for cellular and PCS antennas.  Therefore, in some cases there could be a potential for higher levels of exposure to persons on the ground.  However, all broadcast stations are required to demonstrate compliance with FCC safety guidelines, and ambient exposures to nearby persons from such stations are typically well below FCC safety limits. (Back to Index) ARE EMISSIONS FROM RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST ANTENNAS SAFE?  Radio and television broadcast stations transmit their signals via RF electromagnetic waves.  There are thousands of radio and TV stations on the air in the United States.  Broadcast stations transmit at various RF frequencies, depending on the channel, ranging from about 540 kHz for AM radio up to about 700 MHz for UHF television stations.  Frequencies for FM radio and VHF television lie in between these two extremes.  Broadcast transmitter power levels range from less then a watt to more than 100,000 watts.  Some of these transmission systems can be a significant source of RF energy in the local environment, so the FCC requires that broadcast stations submit evidence of compliance with FCC RF guidelines. The amount of RF energy to which the public or workers might be exposed as a result of broadcast antennas depends on several factors, including the type of station, design characteristics of the antenna being used, power transmitted to the antenna, height of the antenna and distance from the antenna.  Note that the power normally quoted for FM and TV broadcast transmitters is the "effective radiated power" or ERP not the actual transmitter power mentioned above.  ERP is the transmitter power delivered to the antenna multiplied by the directivity or gain of the antenna.  Since high gain antennas direct most of the RF energy toward the horizon and not toward the ground, high ERP transmission systems such as used for UHF-TV broadcast tend to have less ground level field intensity near the station than FM radio broadcast systems with lower ERP and gain values.  Also, since energy at some frequencies is absorbed by the human body more readily than at other frequencies, both the frequency of the transmitted signal and its intensity is important.  Calculations can be performed to predict what field intensity levels would exist at various distances from an antenna. Public access to broadcasting antennas is normally restricted so that individuals cannot be exposed to high-level fields that might exist near antennas.  Measurements made by the FCC, EPA and others have shown that ambient RF radiation levels in inhabited areas near broadcasting facilities are typically well below the exposure levels recommended by current standards and guidelines.  There have been a few situations around the country where RF levels in publicly accessible areas have been found to be higher than those recommended in applicable safety standards.  As they have been identified, the FCC has required that stations at those facilities promptly bring their combined operations into compliance with our guidelines.  Thus, despite the relatively high operating powers of many broadcast stations, such cases are unusual, and members of the general public are unlikely to be exposed to RF levels from broadcast towers that exceed FCC limits Antenna maintenance workers are occasionally required to climb antenna structures for such purposes as painting, repairs, or lamp replacement.  Both the EPA and OSHA have reported that in such cases it is possible for a worker to be exposed to high levels of RF energy if work is performed on an active tower or in areas immediately surrounding a radiating antenna.  Therefore, precautions should be taken to ensure that maintenance personnel are not exposed to unsafe RF fields. (Back to Index) HOW SAFE ARE RADIO ANTENNAS USED FOR PAGING AND "TWO-WAY" COMMUNICATIONS?  WHAT ABOUT "PUSH-TO-TALK" RADIOS SUCH AS "WALKIE-TALKIES?" Land-mobile communications include a variety of communications systems, which require the use of portable and mobile RF transmitting sources.  These systems operate in several frequency bands between about 30 and 1000 MHz.  Radio systems used by the police and fire departments, radio paging services and business radio are a few examples of these communications systems.  They have the advantage of providing communications links between various fixed and mobile locations. There are essentially three types of RF transmitters associated with land-mobile systems:  base-station transmitters, vehicle-mounted transmitters, and hand-held transmitters.  The antennas and power levels used for these various transmitters are adapted for their specific purpose.  For example, a base-station antenna must radiate its signal to a relatively large area, and therefore, its transmitter generally has to use higher power levels than a vehicle-mounted or hand-held radio transmitter.  Although base-station antennas usually operate with higher power levels than other types of land-mobile antennas, they are normally inaccessible to the public since they must be mounted at significant heights above ground to provide for adequate signal coverage.  Also, many of these antennas transmit only intermittently.  For these reasons, base-station antennas are generally not of concern with regard to possible hazardous exposure of the public to RF radiation.  Studies at rooftop locations have indicated that high-powered paging antennas may increase the potential for exposure to workers or others with access to such sites, e.g., maintenance personnel.  This could be a concern especially when multiple transmitters are present.  In such cases, restriction of access or other mitigation actions may be necessary. Transmitting power levels for vehicle-mounted land-mobile antennas are generally less than those used by base-station antennas but higher than those used for hand-held units.  Some manufacturers recommend that users and other nearby individuals maintain some minimum distance (e.g., 1 to 2 feet) from a vehicle-mounted antenna during transmission or mount the antenna in such a way as to provide maximum shielding for vehicle occupants.  Studies have shown that this is probably a conservative precaution, particularly when the percentage of time an antenna is actually radiating is considered.  Unlike cellular telephones, which transmit continuously during a call, two-way radios normally transmit only when the "push-to-talk" button is depressed.  This significantly reduces exposure, and there is no evidence that there would be a safety hazard associated with exposure from vehicle-mounted, two-way antennas when the manufacturer's recommendations are followed. Hand-held "two-way" portable radios such as walkie-talkies are low-powered devices used to transmit and receive messages over relatively short distances.  Because of the low power levels used, the intermittency of these transmissions ("push-to-talk"), and due to the fact that these radios are held away from the head, they should not expose users to RF energy in excess of safe limits.  Although FCC rules do not require routine documentation of compliance with safety limits for push-to-talk two-way radios as it does for cellular and PCS phones (which transmit continuously during use and which are held against the head), most of these radios are tested and the resulting SAR data are available from the FCC’s Equipment Authorization database.  Click on the link for FCC ID Search. (Back to Index) HOW SAFE ARE MICROWAVE AND SATELLITE ANTENNAS?  Point-to-point microwave antennas transmit and receive microwave signals across relatively short distances (from a few tenths of a mile to 30 miles or more).  These antennas are usually circular dish or rectangular in shape and are normally mounted on a supporting tower, rooftop, sides of buildings or on similar structures that provide clear and unobstructed line-of-sight paths between both ends of a transmission path.  These antennas have a variety of uses, such as relaying long-distance telephone calls, and serving as links between broadcast studios and transmitting sites. The RF signals from these antennas travel in a directed beam from a transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna, and dispersion of microwave energy outside of this narrow beam is minimal or insignificant.  In addition, these antennas transmit using very low power levels, usually on the order of a few watts or less.  Measurements have shown that ground-level power densities due to microwave directional antennas are normally thousands of times or more below recommended safety limits.  Moreover, microwave tower sites are normally inaccessible to the general public.  Significant exposures from these antennas could only occur in the unlikely event that an individual were to stand directly in front of and very close to an antenna for a period of time. Ground-based antennas used for satellite-earth communications typically are parabolic dish antennas, some as large as 10 to 30 meters in diameter, that are used to transmit uplink or receive downlink microwave signals to or from satellites in orbit around the earth.  These signals allow delivery of a variety of communications services, including television network programming, electronic news gathering and point-of-sale credit card transactions.   Some satellite-earth station antennas are used only to receive RF signals (i.e., like the satellite television antenna used at a residence), and because they do not transmit, RF exposure is not an issue for those antennas. Since satellite-earth station antennas are directed toward satellites above the earth, transmitted beams point skyward at various angles of inclination, depending on the particular satellite being used.  Because of the longer distances involved, power levels used to transmit these signals are relatively large when compared, for example, to those used by the terrestrial microwave point-to-point antennas discussed above.  However, as with microwave antennas, the beams used for transmitting earth-to-satellite signals are concentrated and highly directional, similar to the beam from a flashlight.  In addition, public access would normally be restricted at uplink sites where exposure levels could approach or exceed safe limits. Although many satellite-earth stations are fixed sites, portable uplink antennas are also used, e.g., for electronic news gathering.  These antennas can be deployed in various locations.  Therefore, precautions may be necessary, such as temporarily restricting access in the vicinity of the antenna, to avoid exposure to the main transmitted beam.  In general, however, it is unlikely that a transmitting earth station antenna would routinely expose members of the public to potentially harmful levels of RF energy. (Back to Index) ARE RF EMISSIONS FROM AMATEUR RADIO STATIONS HARMFUL? There are hundreds of thousands of amateur radio operators ("hams") worldwide.  Amateur radio operators in the United States are licensed by the FCC.  The Amateur Radio Service provides its members with the opportunity to communicate with persons all over the world and to provide valuable public service functions, such as making communications services available during disasters and emergencies.  Like all FCC licensees, amateur radio operators are required to comply with the FCC's guidelines for safe human exposure to RF fields.  Under the FCC's rules, amateur operators can transmit with power levels of up to 1500 watts.  However, most operators use considerably less power than this maximum.  Studies by the FCC and others have shown that most amateur radio transmitters would not normally expose persons to RF levels in excess of safety limits.  This is primarily due to the relatively low operating powers used by most amateurs, the intermittent transmission characteristics typically used and the relative inaccessibility of most amateur antennas.  As long as appropriate distances are maintained from amateur antennas, exposure of nearby persons should be well below safety limits. To help ensure compliance of amateur radio facilities with RF exposure guidelines, both the FCC and American Radio Relay League (ARRL) have issued publications to assist operators in evaluating compliance for their stations.  The FCC's publication (Supplement B to OET Bulletin 65) can be viewed and downloaded elsewhere at this Web site (see "OET RF Safety Bulletins"). (Back to Index) WHAT IS THE FCC'S POLICY ON RADIOFREQUENCY WARNING SIGNS? FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SHOULD SIGNS BE POSTED, WHERE SHOULD THEY BE LOCATED AND WHAT SHOULD THEY SAY?  Radiofrequency warning or alerting signs should be used to provide information on the presence of RF radiation or to control exposure to RF radiation within a given area.  Standard radiofrequency hazard warning signs are commercially available from several vendors.  Appropriate signs should incorporate the format recommended by the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and as specified in the IEEE standard: IEEE Std C95.2-1999 (Web address: http://www.ieee.org).  Guidance concerning the placement of signs can be found in the IEEE Standard: IEEE Std C95.7-2005 (available for free through the IEEE Get Program).  When signs are used, meaningful information should be placed on the sign advising affected persons of:  (1) the nature of the potential hazard (i.e., high RF fields), (2) how to avoid the potential hazard, and (3) whom to contact for additional information.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to also provide instructions to direct individuals as to how to work safely in the RF environment of concern.  Signs should be located prominently in areas that will be readily seen by those persons who may have access to an area where high RF fields are present. (Back to Index) CAN IMPLANTED ELECTRONIC CARDIAC PACEMAKERS BE AFFECTED BY NEARBY RF DEVICES SUCH AS MICROWAVE OVENS OR CELLULAR TELEPHONES?  Over the past several years there has been concern that signals from some RF devices could interfere with the operation of implanted electronic pacemakers and other medical devices.  Because pacemakers are electronic devices, they could be susceptible to electromagnetic signals that could cause them to malfunction.  Some anecdotal claims of such effects in the past involved emissions from microwave ovens.  However, it has never been shown that the RF energy from a properly operating microwave oven is strong enough to cause such interference. Some studies have shown that mobile phones can interfere with implanted cardiac pacemakers if a phone is used in close proximity (within about 8 inches) of a pacemaker.  It appears that such interference is limited to older pacemakers, which may no longer be in use.  Nonetheless, to avoid this potential problem, pacemaker patients can avoid placing a phone in a pocket close to the location of their pacemaker or otherwise place the phone near the pacemaker location during phone use.  Patients with pacemakers should consult with their physician or the FDA if they believe that they may have a problem related to RF interference.  Further information on this is available from the FDA: http://www.fda.gov/Radiation- EmittingProducts/. (Back to Index) DOES THE FCC REGULATE EXPOSURE TO THE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION FROM MICROWAVE OVENS, TELEVISION SETS AND COMPUTER MONITORS? The Commission does not regulate exposure to emissions from these devices.  Protecting the public from harmful radiation emissions from these consumer products is the responsibility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Inquires should be directed to the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and, specifically, to the CDRH Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4654. (Back to Index) DOES THE FCC ROUTINELY MONITOR RADIOFREQUENCY RADIATION FROM ANTENNAS?  The FCC does not have the resources or the personnel to routinely monitor the exposure levels due at all of the thousands of transmitters that are subject to FCC jurisdiction.  However, while there are large variations in exposure levels in the environment of fixed transmitting antennas, it is exceedingly rare for exposure levels to approach FCC public exposure limits in accessible locations.  In addition, the FCC does not routinely perform RF exposure investigations unless there is a reasonable expectation that the FCC exposure limits may be exceeded. (Back to Index) DOES THE FCC MAINTAIN A DATABASE THAT INCLUDES INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION AND TECHNICAL PARAMETERS OF ALL OF THE TRANSMITTER SITES IT REGULATES? The FCC does not have a comprehensive, transmitter-specific database for all of the services it regulates.  However, the FCC does have information for some services such as radio and television broadcast stations, and many larger antenna towers are required to register with the Antenna Structure Registration (ASR) database if they meet certain criteria.  In those cases, location information is generally specified in terms of degrees, minutes, and seconds of latitude and longitude.  In some services, licenses are allowed to utilize additional transmitters or to increase power without notifying the FCC.  Other services are licensed by geographic area, such that the FCC has no knowledge concerning the actual number or location of transmitters within that geographic area. The FCC General Menu Reports (GenMen) search engine unites most of the FCC's licensing databases under a single umbrella.  Databases included are the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau's ULS, the Media Bureau's CDBS, COALS (cable data) and BLS, and the International Bureau's IBFS.  Entry points or search options in the various databases include frequency, state/county, latitude/longitude, call sign and licensee name. The FCC also publishes, generally on a weekly basis, bulk extracts of its various licensing databases.  Each licensing database has its own unique file structure.  These extracts consist of multiple, very large files.  OET maintains an index to these databases. OET has developed a Spectrum Utilization Study Software tool-set that can be used to create a Microsoft Access version of the individual exported licensing databases and then create MapInfo mid and mif files so that radio assignments can be plotted.  This experimental software is used to conduct internal spectrum utilization studies needed in the rule-making process.  While the FCC makes this software available to the public, no technical support is provided. (Back to Index) WHICH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO POTENTIAL RF HEALTH EFFECTS? Certain agencies in the Federal Government have been involved in monitoring, researching or regulating issues related to human exposure to RF radiation.  These agencies include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Department of Defense (DOD). By authority of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the FDA develops performance standards for the emission of radiation from electronic products including X-ray equipment, other medical devices, television sets, microwave ovens, laser products and sunlamps.  The CDRH established a product performance standard for microwave ovens in 1971 limiting the amount of RF leakage from ovens.  However, the CDRH has not adopted performance standards for other RF-emitting products.  The FDA is, however, the lead federal health agency in monitoring the latest research developments and advising other agencies with respect to the safety of RF-emitting products used by the public, such as cellular and PCS phones. The FDA's microwave oven standard is an emission standard (as opposed to an exposure standard) that allows specific levels of microwave energy leakage (measured at five centimeters from the oven surface).  The standard also requires ovens to have two independent interlock systems that prevent the oven from generating microwaves if the latch is released or if the door of the oven is opened.  The FDA has stated that ovens that meet its standards and are used according to the manufacturer's recommendations are safe for consumer and industrial use.  More information is available from: FDA's website for Radiation-Emitting Products. The EPA has, in the past, considered developing federal guidelines for public exposure to RF radiation.  However, EPA activities related to RF safety and health are presently limited to advisory functions.  For example, the EPA chairs an a Radiofrequency Interagency Working Group, which coordinates RF health-related activities among the various federal agencies with health or regulatory responsibilities in this area. OSHA is part of the U.S. Department of Labor, and is responsible for protecting workers from exposure to hazardous chemical and physical agents.  In 1971, OSHA issued a protection guide for exposure of workers to RF radiation [29 CFR 1910.97].  However, this guide was later ruled to be only advisory and not mandatory. Moreover, it was based on an earlier RF exposure standard that has now been revised.  At the present time, OSHA uses the IEEE and/or FCC exposure guidelines for enforcement purposes under OSHA's general duty clause (for more information see: www.osha.gov/SLTC/radiofrequencyradiation/). NIOSH is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  It conducts research and investigations into issues related to occupational exposure to chemical and physical agents.  NIOSH has, in the past, undertaken to develop RF exposure guidelines for workers, but final guidelines were never adopted by the agency.  NIOSH conducts safety-related RF studies through its Engineering and Physical Agents Effects-hazards Branch in Cincinnati, Ohio and the Division of Applied Research and Technology (DART). The NTIA is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and is responsible for authorizing Federal Government use of the RF electromagnetic spectrum.  Like the FCC, the NTIA also has NEPA responsibilities and has considered adopting guidelines for evaluating RF exposure from U.S. Government transmitters such as radar and military facilities. (Back to Index) CAN LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL BODIES ESTABLISH LIMITS FOR RF EXPOSURE?  In the United States, some local and state jurisdictions have also enacted rules and regulations pertaining to human exposure to RF energy.  However, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 contained provisions relating to federal jurisdiction to regulate human exposure to RF emissions from certain transmitting devices.  In particular, Section 704 of the Act states that, "No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission's regulations concerning such emissions."  Further information on FCC policy with respect to facilities siting is available from the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (see https://www.fcc.gov/general/tower-and-antenna-siting) and from "A Local Government Official’s Guide to Transmitting Antenna RF Emission Safety." (Back to Index) WHERE CAN I OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY?

Electromagnetic radiation consists of waves of electric and magnetic energy moving together (i.e., radiating) through space at the speed of light.  Taken together, all forms of electromagnetic energy are referred to as the electromagnetic &quot;spectrum.&quot;  Radio waves and microwaves emitted by transmitting antennas are one form of electromagnetic energy.  They are collectively referred to as &quot;radiofrequency&quot; or &quot;RF&quot; energy or radiation.  Note that the term “radiation” does not mean “radioactive.”  Often, the terms &quot;electromagnetic field&quot; or &quot;radiofrequency field&quot; are used to indicate the presence of electromagnetic or RF energy. The RF waves emanating from an antenna are generated by the movement of electrical charges in the antenna.  Electromagnetic waves can be characterized by a wavelength and a frequency.  The wavelength is the distance covered by one complete cycle of the electromagnetic wave, while the frequency is the number of electromagnetic waves passing a given point in one second.  The frequency of an RF signal is usually expressed in terms of a unit called the &quot;hertz&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Hz&quot;).  One Hz equals one cycle per second.  One megahertz MHz equals one million cycles per second. Different forms of electromagnetic energy are categorized by their wavelengths and frequencies.  The RF part of the electromagnetic spectrum is generally defined as that part of the spectrum where electromagnetic waves have frequencies in the range of about 3 kilohertz (3 kHz) to 300 gigahertz (300 GHz).  Microwaves are a specific category of radio waves that can be loosely defined as radiofrequency energy at frequencies ranging from about 1 GHz to 30 GHz. (Back to Index) WHAT IS NON-IONIZING RADIATION? &quot;Ionization&quot; is a process by which electrons are stripped from atoms and molecules.  This process can produce molecular changes that can lead to damage in biological tissue, including effects on DNA, the genetic material of living organisms.  This process requires interaction with high levels of electromagnetic energy.  Those types of electromagnetic radiation with enough energy to ionize biological material include X-radiation and gamma radiation.  Therefore, X-rays and gamma rays are examples of ionizing radiation. The energy levels associated with RF and microwave radiation, on the other hand, are not great enough to cause the ionization of atoms and molecules, and RF energy is, therefore, is a type of non-ionizing radiation.  Other types of non-ionizing radiation include visible and infrared light.  Often the term &quot;radiation&quot; is used, colloquially, to imply that ionizing radiation (radioactivity), such as that associated with nuclear power plants, is present.  Ionizing radiation should not be confused with the lower-energy, non-ionizing radiation with respect to possible biological effects, since the mechanisms of action are quite different. (Back to Index) HOW IS RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY USED?  The most important use for RF energy is in providing telecommunications services.  Radio and television broadcasting, cellular telephones, personal communications services (PCS), pagers, cordless telephones, business radio, radio communications for police and fire departments, amateur radio, microwave point-to-point links and satellite communications are just a few of the many telecommunications applications of RF energy.  Microwave ovens are an example of a non-telecommunication use of RF energy.  Radiofrequency radiation, especially at microwave frequencies, can transfer energy to water molecules.  High levels of microwave energy will generate heat in water-rich materials such as most foods.  This efficient absorption of microwave energy via water molecules results in rapid heating throughout an object, thus allowing food to be cooked more quickly in a microwave oven than in a conventional oven.  Other important non-telecommunication uses of RF energy include radar and industrial heating and sealing.  Radar is a valuable tool used in many applications range from traffic speed enforcement to air traffic control and military surveillance.  Industrial heaters and sealers generate intense levels of RF radiation that rapidly heats the material being processed in the same way that a microwave oven cooks food.  These devices have many uses in industry, including molding plastic materials, gluing wood products, sealing items such as shoes and pocketbooks, and processing food products.  There are also a number of medical applications of RF energy, such as diathermy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (Back to Index) HOW IS RADIOFREQUENCY RADIATION MEASURED?  An RF electromagnetic wave has both an electric and a magnetic component (electric field and magnetic field), and it is often convenient to express the intensity of the RF environment at a given location in terms of units specific to each component. For example, the unit &quot;volts per meter&quot; (V/m) is used to express the strength of the electric field (electric &quot;field strength&quot;), and the unit &quot;amperes per meter&quot; (A/m) is used to express the strength of the magnetic field (magnetic &quot;field strength&quot;).  Another commonly used unit for characterizing the total electromagnetic field is &quot;power density.&quot;  Power density is most appropriately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from an antenna to be located in the &quot;far-field&quot; zone of the antenna. Power density is defined as power flow per unit area.  For example, power density is commonly expressed in terms of watts per square meter (W/m2), milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2), or microwatts per square centimeter (µW/cm2).  One mW/cm2 equals 10 W/m2, and 100 µW/cm2 equal one W/m2. With respect to frequencies in the microwave range, power density is usually used to express intensity of exposure. The quantity used to measure the rate at which RF energy is actually absorbed in a body is called the &quot;Specific Absorption Rate&quot; or &quot;SAR.&quot;  It is usually expressed in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg) or milliwatts per gram (mW/g).  In the case of exposure of the whole body, a standing ungrounded human adult absorbs RF energy at a maximum rate when the frequency of the RF radiation is in the range of about 70 MHz.  This means that the &quot;whole-body&quot; SAR is at a maximum under these conditions.  Because of this &quot;resonance&quot; phenomenon and consideration of children and grounded adults, RF safety standards are generally most restrictive in the frequency range of about 30 to 300 MHz.  For exposure of parts of the body, such as the exposure from hand-held mobile phones, &quot;partial-body&quot; SAR limits are used in the safety standards to control absorption of RF energy (see later questions on mobile phones).  (Back to Index) WHAT BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS CAN BE CAUSED BY RF ENERGY?  Biological effects can result from exposure to RF energy.  Biological effects that result from heating of tissue by RF energy are often referred to as &quot;thermal&quot; effects.  It has been known for many years that exposure to very high levels of RF radiation can be harmful due to the ability of RF energy to heat biological tissue rapidly.  This is the principle by which microwave ovens cook food.  Exposure to very high RF intensities can result in heating of biological tissue and an increase in body temperature.  Tissue damage in humans could occur during exposure to high RF levels because of the body&#x27;s inability to cope with or dissipate the excessive heat that could be generated.  Two areas of the body, the eyes and the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because of the relative lack of available blood flow to dissipate the excess heat load. At relatively low levels of exposure to RF radiation, i.e., levels lower than those that would produce significant heating, the evidence for production of harmful biological effects is ambiguous and unproven.  Such effects, if they exist, have been referred to as &quot;non-thermal&quot; effects.  A number of reports have appeared in the scientific literature describing the observation of a range of biological effects resulting from exposure to low levels of RF energy.  However, in most cases, further experimental research has been unable to reproduce these effects.  Furthermore, since much of the research is not done on whole bodies (in vivo), there has been no determination that such effects constitute a human health hazard.  It is generally agreed that further research is needed to determine the generality of such effects and their possible relevance, if any, to human health.  In the meantime, standards-setting organizations and government agencies continue to monitor the latest experimental findings to confirm their validity and determine whether changes in safety limits are needed to protect human health. (Back to Index) CAN PEOPLE BE EXPOSED TO LEVELS OF RADIOFREQUENCY RADIATION THAT COULD BE HARMFUL?  Studies have shown that environmental levels of RF energy routinely encountered by the general public are typically far below levels necessary to produce significant heating and increased body temperature.  However, there may be situations, particularly in workplace environments near high-powered RF sources, where the recommended limits for safe exposure of human beings to RF energy could be exceeded.  In such cases, restrictive measures or mitigation actions may be necessary to ensure the safe use of RF energy. (Back to Index) CAN RADIOFREQUENCY RADIATION CAUSE CANCER?  Some studies have also examined the possibility of a link between RF exposure and cancer.  Results to date have been inconclusive.  While some experimental data have suggested a possible link between exposure and tumor formation in animals exposed under certain specific conditions, the results have not been independently replicated.  Many other studies have failed to find evidence for a link to cancer or any related condition.  The Food and Drug Administration has further information on this topic with respect to RF exposure from mobile phones at the following Web site: FDA Radiation-Emitting Products Page . (Back to Index) WHAT RESEARCH IS BEING DONE ON RF BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS? For many years, research into the possible biological effects of RF energy has been carried out in laboratories around the world, and such research is continuing.  Past research has resulted in a large number of peer-reviewed scientific publications on this topic.  For many years the U.S. Government has sponsored research into the biological effects of RF energy.  The majority of this work was initiated by the Department of Defense, due in part, to the extensive military interest in using RF equipment such as radar and other relatively high-powered radio transmitters for routine military operations.  In addition, some U.S. civilian federal agencies responsible for health and safety, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have sponsored and conducted research in this area.  At the present time, other U.S. civilian federal health and safety agencies and institutions, such as the National Toxicology Program and the National Institutes of Health, have also initiated RF bioeffects research. In 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a program called the International EMF Project, which is designed to review the scientific literature concerning biological effects of electromagnetic fields, identify gaps in knowledge about such effects, recommend research needs, and work towards international resolution of health concerns over the use of RF technology.  The WHO maintains a Web site that provides extensive information on this project and about RF biological effects and research (www.who.int/peh-emf/en/). The FDA, the EPA and other federal agencies responsible for public health and safety have worked together and in connection with the WHO to monitor developments and identify research needs related to RF biological effects.  More information about this can be obtained at the FDA Web site: FDA Radiation-Emitting Products - Current Research. (Back to Index) WHAT LEVELS ARE SAFE FOR EXPOSURE TO RF ENERGY?  Exposure standards for radiofrequency energy have been developed by various organizations and governments.  Most modern standards recommend safe levels of exposure separately for the general public and for workers.  In the United States, the FCC has adopted and used recognized safety guidelines for evaluating RF environmental exposure since 1985.  Federal health and safety agencies, such as the EPA, FDA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have also been involved in monitoring and investigating issues related to RF exposure. The FCC guidelines for human exposure to RF electromagnetic fields were derived from the recommendations of two expert organizations, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  Both the NCRP exposure criteria and the IEEE standard were developed by expert scientists and engineers after extensive reviews of the scientific literature related to RF biological effects.  The exposure guidelines are based on thresholds for known adverse effects, and they incorporate prudent margins of safety.  In adopting the current RF exposure guidelines, the FCC consulted with the EPA, FDA, OSHA and NIOSH, and obtained their support for the guidelines that the FCC is using. Many countries in Europe and elsewhere use exposure guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).  The ICNIRP safety limits are generally similar to those of the NCRP and IEEE, with a few exceptions.  For example, ICNIRP recommends somewhat different exposure levels in the lower and upper frequency ranges and for localized exposure due to such devices as hand-held cellular telephones.  One of the goals of the WHO EMF Project (see above) is to provide a framework for international harmonization of RF safety standards.  The NCRP, IEEE and ICNIRP exposure guidelines identify the same threshold level at which harmful biological effects may occur, and the values for Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) recommended for electric and magnetic field strength and power density in both documents are based on this level.  The threshold level is a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value for the whole body of 4 watts per kilogram (4 W/kg).   In addition, the NCRP, IEEE and ICNIRP guidelines for maximum permissible exposure are different for different transmitting frequencies.  This is due to the finding (discussed above) that whole-body human absorption of RF energy varies with the frequency of the RF signal.  The most restrictive limits on whole-body exposure are in the frequency range of 30-300 MHz where the human body absorbs RF energy most efficiently when the whole body is exposed.  For devices that expose only part of the body, such as mobile phones, different exposure limits are specified (see below), but these limits are based on the same underlying threshold level. The exposure limits used by the FCC are expressed in terms of SAR, electric and magnetic field strength and power density for transmitters operating at frequencies from 100 kHz to 100 GHz.  The applicable limits depend upon the type of sources (e.g, whether a cellphone or a broadcast transmitting antenna). The actual values can be found in our informational bulletin available in OET Bulletin 65. (Back to Index) WHY HAS THE FCC ADOPTED GUIDELINES FOR RF EXPOSURE? The FCC authorizes and licenses devices, transmitters and facilities that generate RF radiation.  It has jurisdiction over all transmitting services in the U.S. except those specifically operated by the Federal Government.  However, the FCC&#x27;s primary jurisdiction does not lie in the health and safety area, and it must rely on other agencies and organizations for guidance in these matters. Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), all Federal agencies are required to implement procedures to make environmental consideration a necessary part of an agency&#x27;s decision-making process.  Therefore, FCC approval and licensing of transmitters and facilities must be evaluated for significant impact on the environment.  Human exposure to RF radiation emitted by FCC-regulated transmitters is one of several factors that must be considered in such environmental evaluations.  In 1996, the FCC revised its guidelines for RF exposure as a result of a multi-year proceeding and as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Facilities under the jurisdiction of the FCC having a high potential for creating significant RF exposure to humans, such as radio and television broadcast stations, satellite-earth stations, experimental radio stations and certain cellular, PCS and paging facilities are required to undergo routine evaluation for compliance with RF exposure guidelines whenever an application is submitted to the FCC for construction or modification of a transmitting facility or renewal of a license.  Failure to show compliance with the FCC&#x27;s RF exposure guidelines in the application process could lead to the preparation of a formal Environmental Assessment, possible Environmental Impact Statement and eventual rejection of an application.  Technical guidelines for evaluating compliance with the FCC RF safety requirements can be found in the FCC&#x27;s OET Bulletin 65 (see &quot;OET Safety Bulletins&quot; listing elsewhere at this Web site). Low-powered, intermittent, or inaccessible RF antennas and facilities (including many cell sites) are normally &quot;categorically excluded&quot; from the requirement of routine evaluation for RF exposure.  These exclusions are based on calculations and measurement data indicating that such transmitting stations or devices are unlikely to cause exposures in excess of the guidelines under normal conditions of use.  The FCC&#x27;s policies on RF exposure and categorical exclusion can be found in Section 1.1307(b) of the FCC&#x27;s Rules and Regulations [47 CFR 1.1307(b)].  It should be emphasized, however, that these exclusions are not exclusions from compliance, but, rather, only exclusions from routine evaluation.  Transmitters or facilities that are otherwise categorically excluded from evaluation may be required, on a case-by-case basis, to demonstrate compliance when evidence of potential non-compliance of the transmitter or facility is brought to the Commission&#x27;s attention [see 47 CFR 1.1307(c) and (d)]. (Back to Index) HOW SAFE ARE MOBILE AND PORTABLE PHONES? In recent years, publicity, speculation, and concern over claims of possible health effects due to RF emissions from hand-held wireless telephones prompted various research programs to investigate whether there is any risk to users of these devices  There is no scientific evidence to date that proves that wireless phone usage can lead to cancer or a variety of other health effects, including headaches, dizziness or memory loss.  However, studies are ongoing and key government agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continue to monitor the results of the latest scientific research on these topics.  Also, as noted above, the World Health Organization has established an ongoing program to monitor research in this area and make recommendations related to the safety of mobile phones. The FDA, which has primary jurisdiction for investigating mobile phone safety, has stated that it cannot rule out the possibility of risk, but if such a risk exists, &quot;it is probably small.&quot;  Further, it has stated that, while there is no proof that cellular telephones can be harmful, concerned individuals can take various precautionary actions, including limiting conversations on hand-held cellular telephones and making greater use of telephones with hands-free kits where there is a greater separation distance between the user and the radiating antenna.  The Web site for the FDA&#x27;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health provides further information on mobile phone safety: FDA Radiation-Emitting Products - Cell Phones. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) prepared a report of its investigation into safety concerns related to mobile phones.  The report concluded that further research is needed to confirm whether mobile phones are completely safe for the user, and the report recommended that the FDA take the lead in monitoring the latest research results. The FCC&#x27;s exposure guidelines specify limits for human exposure to RF emissions from hand-held mobile phones in terms of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), a measure of the rate of absorption of RF energy by the body.  The safe limit for a mobile phone user is an SAR of 1.6 watts per kg (1.6 W/kg), averaged over one gram of tissue, and compliance with this limit must be demonstrated before FCC approval is granted for marketing of a phone in the United States.  Somewhat less restrictive limits, e.g., 2 W/kg averaged over 10 grams of tissue, are specified by the ICNIRP guidelines used in Europe and most other countries. Measurements and analysis of SAR in models of the human head have shown that the 1.6 W/kg limit is unlikely to be exceeded under normal conditions of use of cellular and PCS hand-held phones.  The same can be said for cordless telephones used in the home.  Testing of hand-held phones is normally done under conditions of maximum power usage, thus providing an additional margin of safety, since most phone usage is not at maximum power.  Information on SAR levels for many phones is available electronically through the FCC&#x27;s Web site and database (see next question). (Back to Index) HOW CAN I OBTAIN THE SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE (SAR) VALUE FOR MY MOBILE PHONE?  As explained above, the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR, is the unit used to determine compliance of cellular and PCS phones with safety limits adopted by the FCC.  The SAR is a value that corresponds to the rate at which RF energy absorbed in the head of a user of a wireless handset.  The FCC requires mobile phone manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (averaged over one gram of tissue). Information on SAR for a specific cell phone model can be obtained for almost all cellular telephones by using the FCC identification (ID) number for that model.  The FCC ID number is usually printed somewhere on the case of the phone or device.  In many cases, you will have to remove the battery pack to find the number.  Once you have the number proceed as follows. Go to the following website: Equipment Authorization. Click on the link for “FCC ID Search”.  Once you are there you will see instructions for inserting the FCC ID number.  Enter the FCC ID number (in two parts as indicated: &quot;Grantee Code&quot; is comprised of the first three characters, the &quot;Equipment Product Code&quot; is the remainder of the FCC ID).  Then click on &quot;Start Search.&quot;  Grant(s) of Equipment Authorization for this particular FCC ID number should then be available.  Click on a check under &quot;Display Grant&quot; and the grant should appear.  Look through the Grant for the section on SAR compliance, certification of compliance with FCC rules for RF exposure, or similar language.  This section should contain the value(s) for typical or maximum SAR for your phone. For portable phones and devices authorized since June 2, 2000, maximum SAR levels should be noted on the grant of equipment authorization.  For phones and devices authorized between about mid-1998 and June 2000, detailed information on SAR levels is typically found in one of the &quot;exhibits&quot; associated with the grant.  Therefore, once the grant is accessed in the FCC database, the exhibits can be viewed by clicking on the appropriate entry labeled &quot;View Exhibit.&quot;  Electronic records for FCC equipment authorization grants were initiated in 1998, so devices manufactured prior to this date may not be included in our electronic database. Although the FCC database does not list phones by model number, there are certain non-government Web sites such as www.cnet.com, that provide information on SAR from specific models of mobile phones.  However, the FCC has not reviewed these sites for accuracy and makes no guarantees with respect to them.  In addition to these sites, some mobile phone manufacturers make this information available at their own Web sites.  Also, phones certified by the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association (CTIA) are now required to provide this information to consumers in the instructional materials that come with the phones. If you want additional consumer information on safety of cell phones and other transmitting devices please consult the information available below. In particular, you may wish to read or download our further consumer information: Cell Phones: Wireless Devices and Health Concerns, Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) For Cell Phones: What It Means For You, or General Wireless Device FAQ&#x27;s.

(Back to Index) DO &quot;HANDS-FREE&quot; EAR PIECES FOR MOBILE PHONES REDUCE EXPOSURE TO RF EMISSIONS?  WHAT ABOUT MOBILE PHONE ACCESSORIES THAT CLAIM TO SHIELD THE HEAD FROM RF RADIATION?  &quot;Hands-free&quot; kits with ear pieces can be used with cell phones for convenience and comfort.  In addition, because the phone, which is the source of the RF emissions, will not be placed against the head, absorption of RF energy in the head will be reduced.  Therefore, it is true that use of an ear piece connected to a mobile phone will significantly reduce the rate of energy absorption (or &quot;SAR&quot;) in the user&#x27;s head.  On the other hand, if the phone is mounted against the waist or other part of the body during use, then that part of the body will absorb RF energy.  Even so, mobile phones marketed in the U.S. are required to meet safety limit requirements regardless of whether they are used against the head or against the body.  So either configuration should result in compliance with the safety limit.  Note that hands-free devices using Bluetooth technology also include a wireless transmitter; however, the Bluetooth transmitter operates at a much lower power than the cell phone.  A number of devices have been marketed that claim to &quot;shield&quot; or otherwise reduce RF absorption in the body of the user.  Some of these devices incorporate shielded phone cases, while others involve nothing more than a metallic accessory attached to the phone.  Studies have shown that these devices generally do not work as advertised.  In fact, they may actually increase RF absorption in the head due to their potential to interfere with proper operation of the phone, thus forcing it to increase power to compensate.  The Federal Trade Commission has published a Consumer Alert regarding these shields on its website at: FTC Consumer Information - Cell Phone Radiation Scam. (Back to Index) CAN MOBILE PHONES BE USED SAFELY IN HOSPITALS AND NEAR MEDICAL TELEMETRY EQUIPMENT? The FCC does not normally investigate problems of electromagnetic interference from RF transmitters to medical devices.  Some hospitals have policies, which limit the use of cell phones, due to concerns that sensitive medical equipment could be affected.  The FDA&#x27;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has primary jurisdiction for medical device regulation.  FDA staff has monitored this potential problem and more information is available from the CDRH Web site: http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts. (Back to Index) ARE WIRELESS CELLULAR AND PCS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS SAFE?  Cellular wireless radio services transmit using frequencies between 824 and 894 megahertz (MHz).  Transmitters in the Personal Communications Service (PCS) use frequencies in the range of 1850-1990 MHz.  More recently, advanced wireless services have been or are being introduced that transmit at frequencies in the 600, 700, 800, 1695-1780, 1915-1920, 1995-2020, 2110-2200 MHz spectrum ranges. Antennas used for cellular and PCS transmissions are typically located on towers, water tanks or other elevated structures including rooftops and the sides of buildings.  The combination of antennas and associated electronic equipment is referred to as a cellular or PCS &quot;base station&quot; or &quot;cell site.&quot;  Typical heights for free-standing base station towers or structures are 50-200 feet.  A cellular base station may utilize several &quot;omni-directional&quot; antennas that look like poles, 10 to 15 feet in length, although these types of antennas are less common in urbanized areas. In urban and suburban areas, cellular and PCS service providers commonly use &quot;sector&quot; antennas for their base stations.  These antennas are rectangular panels, e.g., about 1 by 4 feet in size, typically mounted on a rooftop or other structure, but they are also mounted on towers or poles.  Panel antennas are usually arranged in three groups of three each.  It is common that not all antennas are used for the transmission of RF energy; some antennas may be receive-only. At a given cell site, the total RF power that could be radiated by the antennas depends on the number of radio channels (transmitters) installed, the power of each transmitter, and the type of antenna.  While it is theoretically possible for cell sites to radiate at very high power levels, the maximum power radiated in any direction usually does not exceed 500 watts.  The RF emissions from cellular or PCS base station antennas are generally directed toward the horizon in a relatively narrow pattern in the vertical plane.  In the case of sector (panel) antennas, the pattern is fan-shaped, like a wedge cut from a pie.  As with all forms of electromagnetic energy, the power density from the antenna decreases rapidly as one moves away from the antenna.  Consequently, ground-level exposures are much less than exposures if one were at the same height and directly in front of the antenna. Measurements made near typical cellular and PCS installations, especially those with tower-mounted antennas, have shown that ground-level power densities are hundreds to thousands of times less than the FCC&#x27;s limits for safe exposure.   This makes it extremely unlikely that a member of the general public could be exposed to RF levels in excess of FCC guidelines due solely to cellular or PCS base station antennas located on towers or monopoles. When cellular and PCS antennas are mounted at rooftop locations it is possible that a person could encounter RF levels greater than those typically encountered on the ground.  However, once again, exposures approaching or exceeding the safety guidelines are only likely to be encountered very close to and directly in front of the antennas.  For sector-type antennas, RF levels to rear are usually very low. (Back to Index) For further information on cellular services go to https://www.fcc.gov/general/cellular-service. ARE CELLULAR AND OTHER RADIO TOWERS LOCATED NEAR HOMES OR SCHOOLS SAFE FOR RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS?  As discussed above, radiofrequency emissions from antennas used for cellular and PCS transmissions result in exposure levels on the ground that are typically thousands of times below safety limits.  These safety limits were adopted by the FCC based on the recommendations of expert organizations and endorsed by agencies of the Federal Government responsible for health and safety.  Therefore, there is no reason to believe that such towers could constitute a potential health hazard to nearby residents or students. Other antennas, such as those used for radio and television broadcast transmissions, use power levels that are generally much higher than those used for cellular and PCS antennas.  Therefore, in some cases there could be a potential for higher levels of exposure to persons on the ground.  However, all broadcast stations are required to demonstrate compliance with FCC safety guidelines, and ambient exposures to nearby persons from such stations are typically well below FCC safety limits. (Back to Index) ARE EMISSIONS FROM RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST ANTENNAS SAFE?  Radio and television broadcast stations transmit their signals via RF electromagnetic waves.  There are thousands of radio and TV stations on the air in the United States.  Broadcast stations transmit at various RF frequencies, depending on the channel, ranging from about 540 kHz for AM radio up to about 700 MHz for UHF television stations.  Frequencies for FM radio and VHF television lie in between these two extremes.  Broadcast transmitter power levels range from less then a watt to more than 100,000 watts.  Some of these transmission systems can be a significant source of RF energy in the local environment, so the FCC requires that broadcast stations submit evidence of compliance with FCC RF guidelines. The amount of RF energy to which the public or workers might be exposed as a result of broadcast antennas depends on several factors, including the type of station, design characteristics of the antenna being used, power transmitted to the antenna, height of the antenna and distance from the antenna.  Note that the power normally quoted for FM and TV broadcast transmitters is the &quot;effective radiated power&quot; or ERP not the actual transmitter power mentioned above.  ERP is the transmitter power delivered to the antenna multiplied by the directivity or gain of the antenna.  Since high gain antennas direct most of the RF energy toward the horizon and not toward the ground, high ERP transmission systems such as used for UHF-TV broadcast tend to have less ground level field intensity near the station than FM radio broadcast systems with lower ERP and gain values.  Also, since energy at some frequencies is absorbed by the human body more readily than at other frequencies, both the frequency of the transmitted signal and its intensity is important.  Calculations can be performed to predict what field intensity levels would exist at various distances from an antenna. Public access to broadcasting antennas is normally restricted so that individuals cannot be exposed to high-level fields that might exist near antennas.  Measurements made by the FCC, EPA and others have shown that ambient RF radiation levels in inhabited areas near broadcasting facilities are typically well below the exposure levels recommended by current standards and guidelines.  There have been a few situations around the country where RF levels in publicly accessible areas have been found to be higher than those recommended in applicable safety standards.  As they have been identified, the FCC has required that stations at those facilities promptly bring their combined operations into compliance with our guidelines.  Thus, despite the relatively high operating powers of many broadcast stations, such cases are unusual, and members of the general public are unlikely to be exposed to RF levels from broadcast towers that exceed FCC limits Antenna maintenance workers are occasionally required to climb antenna structures for such purposes as painting, repairs, or lamp replacement.  Both the EPA and OSHA have reported that in such cases it is possible for a worker to be exposed to high levels of RF energy if work is performed on an active tower or in areas immediately surrounding a radiating antenna.  Therefore, precautions should be taken to ensure that maintenance personnel are not exposed to unsafe RF fields. (Back to Index) HOW SAFE ARE RADIO ANTENNAS USED FOR PAGING AND &quot;TWO-WAY&quot; COMMUNICATIONS?  WHAT ABOUT &quot;PUSH-TO-TALK&quot; RADIOS SUCH AS &quot;WALKIE-TALKIES?&quot; Land-mobile communications include a variety of communications systems, which require the use of portable and mobile RF transmitting sources.  These systems operate in several frequency bands between about 30 and 1000 MHz.  Radio systems used by the police and fire departments, radio paging services and business radio are a few examples of these communications systems.  They have the advantage of providing communications links between various fixed and mobile locations. There are essentially three types of RF transmitters associated with land-mobile systems:  base-station transmitters, vehicle-mounted transmitters, and hand-held transmitters.  The antennas and power levels used for these various transmitters are adapted for their specific purpose.  For example, a base-station antenna must radiate its signal to a relatively large area, and therefore, its transmitter generally has to use higher power levels than a vehicle-mounted or hand-held radio transmitter.  Although base-station antennas usually operate with higher power levels than other types of land-mobile antennas, they are normally inaccessible to the public since they must be mounted at significant heights above ground to provide for adequate signal coverage.  Also, many of these antennas transmit only intermittently.  For these reasons, base-station antennas are generally not of concern with regard to possible hazardous exposure of the public to RF radiation.  Studies at rooftop locations have indicated that high-powered paging antennas may increase the potential for exposure to workers or others with access to such sites, e.g., maintenance personnel.  This could be a concern especially when multiple transmitters are present.  In such cases, restriction of access or other mitigation actions may be necessary. Transmitting power levels for vehicle-mounted land-mobile antennas are generally less than those used by base-station antennas but higher than those used for hand-held units.  Some manufacturers recommend that users and other nearby individuals maintain some minimum distance (e.g., 1 to 2 feet) from a vehicle-mounted antenna during transmission or mount the antenna in such a way as to provide maximum shielding for vehicle occupants.  Studies have shown that this is probably a conservative precaution, particularly when the percentage of time an antenna is actually radiating is considered.  Unlike cellular telephones, which transmit continuously during a call, two-way radios normally transmit only when the &quot;push-to-talk&quot; button is depressed.  This significantly reduces exposure, and there is no evidence that there would be a safety hazard associated with exposure from vehicle-mounted, two-way antennas when the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations are followed. Hand-held &quot;two-way&quot; portable radios such as walkie-talkies are low-powered devices used to transmit and receive messages over relatively short distances.  Because of the low power levels used, the intermittency of these transmissions (&quot;push-to-talk&quot;), and due to the fact that these radios are held away from the head, they should not expose users to RF energy in excess of safe limits.  Although FCC rules do not require routine documentation of compliance with safety limits for push-to-talk two-way radios as it does for cellular and PCS phones (which transmit continuously during use and which are held against the head), most of these radios are tested and the resulting SAR data are available from the FCC’s Equipment Authorization database.  Click on the link for FCC ID Search. (Back to Index) HOW SAFE ARE MICROWAVE AND SATELLITE ANTENNAS?  Point-to-point microwave antennas transmit and receive microwave signals across relatively short distances (from a few tenths of a mile to 30 miles or more).  These antennas are usually circular dish or rectangular in shape and are normally mounted on a supporting tower, rooftop, sides of buildings or on similar structures that provide clear and unobstructed line-of-sight paths between both ends of a transmission path.  These antennas have a variety of uses, such as relaying long-distance telephone calls, and serving as links between broadcast studios and transmitting sites. The RF signals from these antennas travel in a directed beam from a transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna, and dispersion of microwave energy outside of this narrow beam is minimal or insignificant.  In addition, these antennas transmit using very low power levels, usually on the order of a few watts or less.  Measurements have shown that ground-level power densities due to microwave directional antennas are normally thousands of times or more below recommended safety limits.  Moreover, microwave tower sites are normally inaccessible to the general public.  Significant exposures from these antennas could only occur in the unlikely event that an individual were to stand directly in front of and very close to an antenna for a period of time. Ground-based antennas used for satellite-earth communications typically are parabolic dish antennas, some as large as 10 to 30 meters in diameter, that are used to transmit uplink or receive downlink microwave signals to or from satellites in orbit around the earth.  These signals allow delivery of a variety of communications services, including television network programming, electronic news gathering and point-of-sale credit card transactions.   Some satellite-earth station antennas are used only to receive RF signals (i.e., like the satellite television antenna used at a residence), and because they do not transmit, RF exposure is not an issue for those antennas. Since satellite-earth station antennas are directed toward satellites above the earth, transmitted beams point skyward at various angles of inclination, depending on the particular satellite being used.  Because of the longer distances involved, power levels used to transmit these signals are relatively large when compared, for example, to those used by the terrestrial microwave point-to-point antennas discussed above.  However, as with microwave antennas, the beams used for transmitting earth-to-satellite signals are concentrated and highly directional, similar to the beam from a flashlight.  In addition, public access would normally be restricted at uplink sites where exposure levels could approach or exceed safe limits. Although many satellite-earth stations are fixed sites, portable uplink antennas are also used, e.g., for electronic news gathering.  These antennas can be deployed in various locations.  Therefore, precautions may be necessary, such as temporarily restricting access in the vicinity of the antenna, to avoid exposure to the main transmitted beam.  In general, however, it is unlikely that a transmitting earth station antenna would routinely expose members of the public to potentially harmful levels of RF energy. (Back to Index) ARE RF EMISSIONS FROM AMATEUR RADIO STATIONS HARMFUL? There are hundreds of thousands of amateur radio operators (&quot;hams&quot;) worldwide.  Amateur radio operators in the United States are licensed by the FCC.  The Amateur Radio Service provides its members with the opportunity to communicate with persons all over the world and to provide valuable public service functions, such as making communications services available during disasters and emergencies.  Like all FCC licensees, amateur radio operators are required to comply with the FCC&#x27;s guidelines for safe human exposure to RF fields.  Under the FCC&#x27;s rules, amateur operators can transmit with power levels of up to 1500 watts.  However, most operators use considerably less power than this maximum.  Studies by the FCC and others have shown that most amateur radio transmitters would not normally expose persons to RF levels in excess of safety limits.  This is primarily due to the relatively low operating powers used by most amateurs, the intermittent transmission characteristics typically used and the relative inaccessibility of most amateur antennas.  As long as appropriate distances are maintained from amateur antennas, exposure of nearby persons should be well below safety limits. To help ensure compliance of amateur radio facilities with RF exposure guidelines, both the FCC and American Radio Relay League (ARRL) have issued publications to assist operators in evaluating compliance for their stations.  The FCC&#x27;s publication (Supplement B to OET Bulletin 65) can be viewed and downloaded elsewhere at this Web site (see &quot;OET RF Safety Bulletins&quot;). (Back to Index) WHAT IS THE FCC&#x27;S POLICY ON RADIOFREQUENCY WARNING SIGNS? FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SHOULD SIGNS BE POSTED, WHERE SHOULD THEY BE LOCATED AND WHAT SHOULD THEY SAY?  Radiofrequency warning or alerting signs should be used to provide information on the presence of RF radiation or to control exposure to RF radiation within a given area.  Standard radiofrequency hazard warning signs are commercially available from several vendors.  Appropriate signs should incorporate the format recommended by the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and as specified in the IEEE standard: IEEE Std C95.2-1999 (Web address: http://www.ieee.org).  Guidance concerning the placement of signs can be found in the IEEE Standard: IEEE Std C95.7-2005 (available for free through the IEEE Get Program).  When signs are used, meaningful information should be placed on the sign advising affected persons of:  (1) the nature of the potential hazard (i.e., high RF fields), (2) how to avoid the potential hazard, and (3) whom to contact for additional information.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to also provide instructions to direct individuals as to how to work safely in the RF environment of concern.  Signs should be located prominently in areas that will be readily seen by those persons who may have access to an area where high RF fields are present. (Back to Index) CAN IMPLANTED ELECTRONIC CARDIAC PACEMAKERS BE AFFECTED BY NEARBY RF DEVICES SUCH AS MICROWAVE OVENS OR CELLULAR TELEPHONES?  Over the past several years there has been concern that signals from some RF devices could interfere with the operation of implanted electronic pacemakers and other medical devices.  Because pacemakers are electronic devices, they could be susceptible to electromagnetic signals that could cause them to malfunction.  Some anecdotal claims of such effects in the past involved emissions from microwave ovens.  However, it has never been shown that the RF energy from a properly operating microwave oven is strong enough to cause such interference. Some studies have shown that mobile phones can interfere with implanted cardiac pacemakers if a phone is used in close proximity (within about 8 inches) of a pacemaker.  It appears that such interference is limited to older pacemakers, which may no longer be in use.  Nonetheless, to avoid this potential problem, pacemaker patients can avoid placing a phone in a pocket close to the location of their pacemaker or otherwise place the phone near the pacemaker location during phone use.  Patients with pacemakers should consult with their physician or the FDA if they believe that they may have a problem related to RF interference.  Further information on this is available from the FDA: http://www.fda.gov/Radiation- EmittingProducts/. (Back to Index) DOES THE FCC REGULATE EXPOSURE TO THE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION FROM MICROWAVE OVENS, TELEVISION SETS AND COMPUTER MONITORS? The Commission does not regulate exposure to emissions from these devices.  Protecting the public from harmful radiation emissions from these consumer products is the responsibility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Inquires should be directed to the FDA&#x27;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and, specifically, to the CDRH Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4654. (Back to Index) DOES THE FCC ROUTINELY MONITOR RADIOFREQUENCY RADIATION FROM ANTENNAS?  The FCC does not have the resources or the personnel to routinely monitor the exposure levels due at all of the thousands of transmitters that are subject to FCC jurisdiction.  However, while there are large variations in exposure levels in the environment of fixed transmitting antennas, it is exceedingly rare for exposure levels to approach FCC public exposure limits in accessible locations.  In addition, the FCC does not routinely perform RF exposure investigations unless there is a reasonable expectation that the FCC exposure limits may be exceeded. (Back to Index) DOES THE FCC MAINTAIN A DATABASE THAT INCLUDES INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION AND TECHNICAL PARAMETERS OF ALL OF THE TRANSMITTER SITES IT REGULATES? The FCC does not have a comprehensive, transmitter-specific database for all of the services it regulates.  However, the FCC does have information for some services such as radio and television broadcast stations, and many larger antenna towers are required to register with the Antenna Structure Registration (ASR) database if they meet certain criteria.  In those cases, location information is generally specified in terms of degrees, minutes, and seconds of latitude and longitude.  In some services, licenses are allowed to utilize additional transmitters or to increase power without notifying the FCC.  Other services are licensed by geographic area, such that the FCC has no knowledge concerning the actual number or location of transmitters within that geographic area. The FCC General Menu Reports (GenMen) search engine unites most of the FCC&#x27;s licensing databases under a single umbrella.  Databases included are the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau&#x27;s ULS, the Media Bureau&#x27;s CDBS, COALS (cable data) and BLS, and the International Bureau&#x27;s IBFS.  Entry points or search options in the various databases include frequency, state/county, latitude/longitude, call sign and licensee name. The FCC also publishes, generally on a weekly basis, bulk extracts of its various licensing databases.  Each licensing database has its own unique file structure.  These extracts consist of multiple, very large files.  OET maintains an index to these databases. OET has developed a Spectrum Utilization Study Software tool-set that can be used to create a Microsoft Access version of the individual exported licensing databases and then create MapInfo mid and mif files so that radio assignments can be plotted.  This experimental software is used to conduct internal spectrum utilization studies needed in the rule-making process.  While the FCC makes this software available to the public, no technical support is provided. (Back to Index) WHICH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO POTENTIAL RF HEALTH EFFECTS? Certain agencies in the Federal Government have been involved in monitoring, researching or regulating issues related to human exposure to RF radiation.  These agencies include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Department of Defense (DOD). By authority of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the FDA develops performance standards for the emission of radiation from electronic products including X-ray equipment, other medical devices, television sets, microwave ovens, laser products and sunlamps.  The CDRH established a product performance standard for microwave ovens in 1971 limiting the amount of RF leakage from ovens.  However, the CDRH has not adopted performance standards for other RF-emitting products.  The FDA is, however, the lead federal health agency in monitoring the latest research developments and advising other agencies with respect to the safety of RF-emitting products used by the public, such as cellular and PCS phones. The FDA&#x27;s microwave oven standard is an emission standard (as opposed to an exposure standard) that allows specific levels of microwave energy leakage (measured at five centimeters from the oven surface).  The standard also requires ovens to have two independent interlock systems that prevent the oven from generating microwaves if the latch is released or if the door of the oven is opened.  The FDA has stated that ovens that meet its standards and are used according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations are safe for consumer and industrial use.  More information is available from: FDA&#x27;s website for Radiation-Emitting Products. The EPA has, in the past, considered developing federal guidelines for public exposure to RF radiation.  However, EPA activities related to RF safety and health are presently limited to advisory functions.  For example, the EPA chairs an a Radiofrequency Interagency Working Group, which coordinates RF health-related activities among the various federal agencies with health or regulatory responsibilities in this area. OSHA is part of the U.S. Department of Labor, and is responsible for protecting workers from exposure to hazardous chemical and physical agents.  In 1971, OSHA issued a protection guide for exposure of workers to RF radiation [29 CFR 1910.97].  However, this guide was later ruled to be only advisory and not mandatory. Moreover, it was based on an earlier RF exposure standard that has now been revised.  At the present time, OSHA uses the IEEE and/or FCC exposure guidelines for enforcement purposes under OSHA&#x27;s general duty clause (for more information see: www.osha.gov/SLTC/radiofrequencyradiation/). NIOSH is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  It conducts research and investigations into issues related to occupational exposure to chemical and physical agents.  NIOSH has, in the past, undertaken to develop RF exposure guidelines for workers, but final guidelines were never adopted by the agency.  NIOSH conducts safety-related RF studies through its Engineering and Physical Agents Effects-hazards Branch in Cincinnati, Ohio and the Division of Applied Research and Technology (DART). The NTIA is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and is responsible for authorizing Federal Government use of the RF electromagnetic spectrum.  Like the FCC, the NTIA also has NEPA responsibilities and has considered adopting guidelines for evaluating RF exposure from U.S. Government transmitters such as radar and military facilities. (Back to Index) CAN LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL BODIES ESTABLISH LIMITS FOR RF EXPOSURE?  In the United States, some local and state jurisdictions have also enacted rules and regulations pertaining to human exposure to RF energy.  However, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 contained provisions relating to federal jurisdiction to regulate human exposure to RF emissions from certain transmitting devices.  In particular, Section 704 of the Act states that, &quot;No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission&#x27;s regulations concerning such emissions.&quot;  Further information on FCC policy with respect to facilities siting is available from the FCC&#x27;s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (see https://www.fcc.gov/general/tower-and-antenna-siting) and from &quot;A Local Government Official’s Guide to Transmitting Antenna RF Emission Safety.&quot; (Back to Index) WHERE CAN I OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY?

These safety codes specify the requirements for the safe use of, or exposure to, radiation emitting devices. This revision replaces the previous version of Safety Code 6 (2009). The purpose of this code is to establish safety limits for human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields in the frequency range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. The safety limits in this code apply to all individuals working at, or visiting, federally regulated sites. These guidelines may also be adopted by the provinces, industry or other interested parties. The Department of National Defence shall conform to the requirements of this safety code, except in such cases where it considers such compliance to have a detrimental effect on its activities in support of training and operations of the Canadian Forces. This code has been adopted as the scientific basis for equipment certification and RF field exposure compliance specifications outlined in Industry Canada's regulatory documents (1-3), that govern the use of wireless devices in Canada, such as cell phones, cell towers (base stations) and broadcast antennas. Safety Code 6 does not apply to the deliberate exposure for treatment of patients by, or under the direction of, medical practitioners. Safety Code 6 is not intended for use as a product performance specification document, as the limits in this safety code are for controlling human exposure and are independent of the source of RF energy. In a field where technology is advancing rapidly and where unexpected and unique exposure scenarios may occur, this code cannot cover all possible situations. Consequently, the specifications in this code may require interpretation under special circumstances. This interpretation should be done in consultation with scientific staff at the Consumer and Clinical Radiation Protection Bureau, Health Canada. The safety limits in this code are based on an ongoing review of published scientific studies on the health impacts of RF energy and how it interacts with the human body. This code is periodically revised to reflect new knowledge in the scientific literature and the exposure limits may be modified, if deemed necessary. Electromagnetic radiation is emitted by many natural and man-made sources and is a fundamental aspect of our lives. We are warmed by electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and our eyes can detect the visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radiofrequency (RF) fields fall within a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with frequencies ranging from 3 kHz to 300 GHz, below that of visible light and above that of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields. RF fields are produced by many man-made sources including cellular (mobile) phones and base stations, television and radio broadcasting facilities, radar, medical equipment, microwave ovens, RF induction heaters as well as a diverse assortment of other electronic devices within our living and working environments. A number of biological effects and established adverse health effects from acute exposure to RF fields have been documented (4-9). These effects relate to localized heating or stimulation of excitable tissue. The specific biological responses to RF fields are generally related to the rate of energy absorbed or the strength of internal electric fields (voltage gradients) and currents. The rate and distribution of RF energy absorption depend strongly on the frequency, strength and orientation of the incident fields as well as the body size and its constitutive electrical properties (dielectric constant and conductivity). Absorption of RF energy is commonly described in terms of the specific absorption rate (SAR), which is a measure of the rate of energy deposition per unit mass of body tissue and is usually expressed in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). Based on a large amount of scientific knowledge, national and international exposure limits have been established to protect the general public against all adverse effects associated with RF field exposures (10-14). The exposure limits specified in Safety Code 6 have been established based upon a thorough evaluation of the scientific literature related to the thermal and non-thermal health effects of RF fields. Health Canada scientists consider all peer-reviewed scientific studies, on an ongoing basis, and employ a weight-of-evidence approach when evaluating the possible health risks of exposure to RF fields. This approach takes into account the quantity of studies on a particular endpoint (whether adverse or no effect), but more importantly, the quality of those studies. Poorly conducted studies (e.g. those with incomplete dosimetry or inadequate control samples) receive relatively little weight, while properly conducted studies (e.g. all controls included, appropriate statistics, complete dosimetry) receive more weight. The exposure limits in Safety Code 6 are based upon the lowest exposure level at which any scientifically established adverse health effect occurs. Safety margins have been incorporated into the exposure limits to ensure that even worst-case exposures remain far below the threshold for harm. The scientific approach used to establish the exposure limits in Safety Code 6 is comparable to that employed by other science-based international standards bodies (15-16). As such, the basic restrictions in Safety Code 6 are similar to those adopted by most other nations, since all science-based, standard-setting bodies use the same scientific data. It must be stressed that Safety Code 6 is based upon established adverse health effects and should be distinguished from some municipal and/or national guidelines that are based on socio-political considerations. In the following sections, the maximum exposure levels for persons in both controlled and uncontrolled environments are specified. These levels shall not be exceeded. The purpose of this code is to specify maximum levels of human exposure to RF fields at frequencies between 3 kHz and 300 GHz, to prevent adverse human health effects in both controlled and uncontrolled environments. In this code, controlled environments are defined as those where all of the following conditions are satisfied: Situations that do not meet all the specifications above are considered to be uncontrolled environments. Uncontrolled environments are defined as areas where either insufficient assessment of RF fields has been conducted or where persons who are allowed access to these areas have not received proper RF field awareness/safety training and have no means to assess or, if required, to mitigate their exposure to RF fields. The scientific literature with respect to possible biological effects of RF fields has been monitored by Health Canada scientists on an ongoing basis. Since the last version of Safety Code 6 was published (2009), a significant number of new studies have evaluated the potential for acute and chronic RF field exposures to elicit possible effects on a wide range of biological endpoints including: human cancers; rodent lifetime mortality; tumor initiation, promotion and co-promotion; mutagenicity and DNA damage; EEG activity; memory, behaviour and cognitive functions; gene and protein expression; cardiovascular function; immune response; reproductive outcomes; and perceived electromagnetic hypersensitivity among others. Numerous authoritative reviews have summarized the current literature (4-8, 17-40). Despite the advent of numerous additional research studies on RF fields and health, the only established adverse health effects associated with RF field exposures in the frequency range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz relate to the occurrence of tissue heating and nerve stimulation (NS) from short-term (acute) exposures. At present, there is no scientific basis for the occurrence of acute, chronic and/or cumulative adverse health risks from RF field exposure at levels below the limits outlined in Safety Code 6. The hypotheses of other proposed adverse health effects occurring at levels below the exposure limits outlined in Safety Code 6 suffer from a lack of evidence of causality, biological plausibility and reproducibility and do not provide a credible foundation for making science-based recommendations for limiting human exposures to low-intensity RF fields. This safety code provides guidance for the avoidance of adverse human health effects resulting from exposure to RF fields, in terms of basic restrictions and/or reference levels. Basic restrictions are exposure indices within the body that should not be exceeded. These exposure indices are directly linked to established adverse health effects. The basic restrictions in this safety code are specified in terms of: a) internal electric field strength; and b) the rate of RF energy absorption (SAR). Since measurements of the SAR or internal electric field strength are often difficult to perform, reference levels for maximum human exposure to RF fields have also been specified in this safety code. The reference levels are specified in terms of unperturbed, externally applied electric- and magnetic-field strength, power density and in terms of electric currents in the body occurring from either induction or contact with energized metallic objects. They were established using dosimetric analyses that determined the levels of externally applied field strengths that would produce the basic restrictions within the body. While compliance with the basic restrictions is required, non-compliance with the reference levels does not necessarily mean that the basic restrictions are not respected. In such cases, additional measurements or calculations may be required to assess compliance. For frequencies from 3 kHz to 10 MHz, NS from induced electric fields within the body must be avoided. Experimental studies have demonstrated that electric and magnetic field exposures can induce internal electric fields (voltage gradients) within biological tissue which, if sufficiently intense, can alter the "resting" membrane potential of excitable tissues resulting in spontaneous depolarization of the membrane and the generation of spurious action potentials (5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 35, 41). Basic restrictions for the avoidance of NS are specified in this safety code in terms of maximum internal electric field strength within the body. For frequencies from 100 kHz to 300 GHz, tissue heating can occur and must be limited. Basic restrictions have been specified in this safety code for RF field exposures in the 100 kHz to 6 GHz frequency range, in terms of maximum whole-body SAR (averaged over the whole-body) and peak spatially-averaged SAR, (averaged over a small cubical volume). For frequencies above 6 GHz, RF energy absorption occurs predominantly in surface tissues (e.g. upper layers of skin) and the use of maximum SAR limits, either whole-body or averaged over a cubical volume, is not appropriate. In lieu of basic restrictions, reference levels are specified for maximum unperturbed, externally applied electric- and magnetic-field strengths and in terms of power density, for the avoidance of thermal effects. Studies in animals, including non-human primates, have consistently demonstrated a threshold effect for the occurrence of behavioural changes and alterations in core body temperature of ~1.0°C, at a whole-body average SAR of ~4 W/kg (5-8, 11, 12, 14, 36). Thermoregulatory studies in human volunteers exposed to RF fields under a variety of exposure scenarios have provided supporting information on RF field induced thermal responses in humans (42). This information forms the scientific basis for the basic restrictions on whole-body average SAR in Safety Code 6. To ensure that thermal effects are avoided, safety factors have been incorporated into the exposure limits, resulting in whole-body-averaged SAR limits of 0.08 and 0.4 W/kg in uncontrolled- and controlled-environments, respectively. Basic restrictions on peak spatially-averaged SAR have also been established in Safety Code 6 to avoid adverse thermal effects in localized human tissues (hot-spots). The peak spatially-averaged SAR limits reflect the highly heterogeneous nature of typical RF field exposures and the differing thermoregulatory properties of various body tissues. The peak spatially-averaged SAR limits pertain to discrete tissue volumes (1 or 10 g, in the shape of a cube), where thermoregulation can efficiently dissipate heat and avoid changes in body temperature that are greater than 1°C. As such, the peak spatially-averaged SAR limits for exposures in controlled environments are 20 W/kg for the limbs and 8 W/kg for the head, neck and trunk. For exposures in uncontrolled environments, the peak spatially-averaged SAR limits are 4.0 W/kg for the limbs and 1.6 W/kg for the head, neck and trunk. For frequencies from 100 kHz to 10 MHz, since either NS or thermal effects could occur, depending upon the exposure conditions (frequency, duty cycle, orientation), basic restrictions for both internal electric field strength and SAR (whole-body and peak spatially-averaged) must be simultaneously respected. Safety Code 6 also specifies reference levels in the 3 kHz to 110 MHz frequency range, in terms of induced- or contact-currents (mA), for the avoidance of perception (nerve stimulation), shocks or burns (4, 6). While the biological basis for the basic restrictions specified in this safety code has not changed since the previous version (2009), the reference levels have been updated to either account for dosimetric refinements in recent years (43-64) or where feasible, to harmonize with those of ICNIRP (10-11). To determine whether the maximum exposure levels are exceeded, full consideration shall be given to such factors as: Where comparison is to be made to the SAR-based basic restrictions and/or reference levels at frequencies in the 100 kHz - 300 GHz range, higher exposure levels may be permitted for short durations of time under certain circumstances. For these situations, the field strengths, power densities and body currents averaged over any one tenth-hour reference period (6 minutes) shall not exceed the limits outlined in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. SI units are used throughout this document unless specified otherwise. Limits for internal electric field strength are intended to prevent the occurrence of NS. At frequencies between 3 kHz and 10 MHz, basic restrictions for internal electric field strength in excitable tissues (Table 1) shall not be exceeded. For conditions where the determination of internal electric field strength is not possible or practical (e.g. by measurement or modelling), external unperturbed field strength assessment shall be carried out and the reference levels outlined in Section 2.2 shall be respected. The SAR is a measure of the rate at which electromagnetic energy is absorbed in the body. Basic restrictions for SAR are intended to prevent the occurrence of thermal effects from RF energy exposure on the body. At frequencies between 100 kHz and 6 GHz, the SAR limits (Table 2) take precedence over field strength and power density reference levels (Section 2.2) and shall not be exceeded. The SAR should be determined for situations where exposures occur at a distance of 0.2 m or less from the source. In all cases, the values in Table 2 shall not be exceeded. For conditions where SAR determination is impractical, external unperturbed field strength or power density measurements shall be carried out and the limits outlined in Section 2.2 shall be respected. Table 2 footnotes Defined as a tissue volume in the shape of a cube. Return to the first table 2 footnote 1 referrer Averaged over any 6 minute reference period. Return to table 2 footnote 2 referrer For frequencies above 6 GHz, energy deposition occurs predominantly in the uppermost layers of superficial tissues (e.g. skin, cornea). In this case, power density is a more appropriate exposure limit metric. Therefore, for the frequency range from 6 GHz to 300 GHz, the incident unperturbed power density and its derived electric- and magnetic-field strengths (assuming a free-space impedance of 377 ohms) form the basic restriction in this safety code (Section 2.2.2) and shall not be exceeded. In practice, direct measurements of internal electric fields or SAR are often only feasible under laboratory conditions. Therefore, reference levels are specified in this safety code in terms of external unperturbed electric and magnetic field strength, power density, as well as induced and contact currents. In the far-field zone of an electromagnetic source, electric field strength, magnetic field strength and power density are interrelated by simple mathematical expressions, where any one of these parameters defines the remaining two. In the near-field zone, both the unperturbed electric- and magnetic-field strengths shall be measured, since there is no simple relationship between these two quantities. Instrumentation for the measurement of magnetic fields at certain frequencies may not be commercially available. In this case, the electric field strength shall be measured and used for assessing compliance with the reference levels in this code. To ensure compliance with the basic restrictions outlined in Section 2.1, at frequencies between 0.003 MHz and 10 MHz, both the NS- and SAR-based reference levels for electric- and magnetic-field strength must be complied with simultaneously at frequencies where reference levels for both apply. Frequency, f, is in MHz. The precise frequencies at which SAR-based electric field strength reference levels for Uncontrolled and Controlled Environments begin are 1.10 MHz and 1.29 MHz, respectively.

Contact current is defined as the total current flowing through the body to ground resulting from finger-touch contact with a conductive object insulated from the ground that has been energized in an electric field. Conversely, it can be defined as the total current flowing in an insulated body that has been energized in an electric field and is in finger-touch contact with a grounded conductive object. The current path in the body is from point of touch to ground through the feet. The total current can be assessed anywhere along the path of flow. Frequency, f, is in MHz.

Absorption of RF energy is commonly described in terms of the specific absorption rate (SAR), which is a measure of the rate of energy deposition per unit mass of body tissue and is usually expressed in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). Based on a large amount of scientific knowledge, national and international exposure limits have been established to protect the general public against all adverse effects associated with RF field exposures (10-14). The exposure limits specified in Safety Code 6 have been established based upon a thorough evaluation of the scientific literature related to the thermal and non-thermal health effects of RF fields. Health Canada scientists consider all peer-reviewed scientific studies, on an ongoing basis, and employ a weight-of-evidence approach when evaluating the possible health risks of exposure to RF fields. This approach takes into account the quantity of studies on a particular endpoint (whether adverse or no effect), but more importantly, the quality of those studies. Poorly conducted studies (e.g. those with incomplete dosimetry or inadequate control samples) receive relatively little weight, while properly conducted studies (e.g. all controls included, appropriate statistics, complete dosimetry) receive more weight. The exposure limits in Safety Code 6 are based upon the lowest exposure level at which any scientifically established adverse health effect occurs. Safety margins have been incorporated into the exposure limits to ensure that even worst-case exposures remain far below the threshold for harm. The scientific approach used to establish the exposure limits in Safety Code 6 is comparable to that employed by other science-based international standards bodies (15-16). As such, the basic restrictions in Safety Code 6 are similar to those adopted by most other nations, since all science-based, standard-setting bodies use the same scientific data. It must be stressed that Safety Code 6 is based upon established adverse health effects and should be distinguished from some municipal and/or national guidelines that are based on socio-political considerations. In the following sections, the maximum exposure levels for persons in both controlled and uncontrolled environments are specified. These levels shall not be exceeded. The purpose of this code is to specify maximum levels of human exposure to RF fields at frequencies between 3 kHz and 300 GHz, to prevent adverse human health effects in both controlled and uncontrolled environments. In this code, controlled environments are defined as those where all of the following conditions are satisfied: Situations that do not meet all the specifications above are considered to be uncontrolled environments. Uncontrolled environments are defined as areas where either insufficient assessment of RF fields has been conducted or where persons who are allowed access to these areas have not received proper RF field awareness/safety training and have no means to assess or, if required, to mitigate their exposure to RF fields. The scientific literature with respect to possible biological effects of RF fields has been monitored by Health Canada scientists on an ongoing basis. Since the last version of Safety Code 6 was published (2009), a significant number of new studies have evaluated the potential for acute and chronic RF field exposures to elicit possible effects on a wide range of biological endpoints including: human cancers; rodent lifetime mortality; tumor initiation, promotion and co-promotion; mutagenicity and DNA damage; EEG activity; memory, behaviour and cognitive functions; gene and protein expression; cardiovascular function; immune response; reproductive outcomes; and perceived electromagnetic hypersensitivity among others. Numerous authoritative reviews have summarized the current literature (4-8, 17-40). Despite the advent of numerous additional research studies on RF fields and health, the only established adverse health effects associated with RF field exposures in the frequency range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz relate to the occurrence of tissue heating and nerve stimulation (NS) from short-term (acute) exposures. At present, there is no scientific basis for the occurrence of acute, chronic and/or cumulative adverse health risks from RF field exposure at levels below the limits outlined in Safety Code 6. The hypotheses of other proposed adverse health effects occurring at levels below the exposure limits outlined in Safety Code 6 suffer from a lack of evidence of causality, biological plausibility and reproducibility and do not provide a credible foundation for making science-based recommendations for limiting human exposures to low-intensity RF fields. This safety code provides guidance for the avoidance of adverse human health effects resulting from exposure to RF fields, in terms of basic restrictions and/or reference levels. Basic restrictions are exposure indices within the body that should not be exceeded. These exposure indices are directly linked to established adverse health effects. The basic restrictions in this safety code are specified in terms of: a) internal electric field strength; and b) the rate of RF energy absorption (SAR). Since measurements of the SAR or internal electric field strength are often difficult to perform, reference levels for maximum human exposure to RF fields have also been specified in this safety code. The reference levels are specified in terms of unperturbed, externally applied electric- and magnetic-field strength, power density and in terms of electric currents in the body occurring from either induction or contact with energized metallic objects. They were established using dosimetric analyses that determined the levels of externally applied field strengths that would produce the basic restrictions within the body. While compliance with the basic restrictions is required, non-compliance with the reference levels does not necessarily mean that the basic restrictions are not respected. In such cases, additional measurements or calculations may be required to assess compliance. For frequencies from 3 kHz to 10 MHz, NS from induced electric fields within the body must be avoided. Experimental studies have demonstrated that electric and magnetic field exposures can induce internal electric fields (voltage gradients) within biological tissue which, if sufficiently intense, can alter the &quot;resting&quot; membrane potential of excitable tissues resulting in spontaneous depolarization of the membrane and the generation of spurious action potentials (5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 35, 41). Basic restrictions for the avoidance of NS are specified in this safety code in terms of maximum internal electric field strength within the body. For frequencies from 100 kHz to 300 GHz, tissue heating can occur and must be limited. Basic restrictions have been specified in this safety code for RF field exposures in the 100 kHz to 6 GHz frequency range, in terms of maximum whole-body SAR (averaged over the whole-body) and peak spatially-averaged SAR, (averaged over a small cubical volume). For frequencies above 6 GHz, RF energy absorption occurs predominantly in surface tissues (e.g. upper layers of skin) and the use of maximum SAR limits, either whole-body or averaged over a cubical volume, is not appropriate. In lieu of basic restrictions, reference levels are specified for maximum unperturbed, externally applied electric- and magnetic-field strengths and in terms of power density, for the avoidance of thermal effects. Studies in animals, including non-human primates, have consistently demonstrated a threshold effect for the occurrence of behavioural changes and alterations in core body temperature of ~1.0°C, at a whole-body average SAR of ~4 W/kg (5-8, 11, 12, 14, 36). Thermoregulatory studies in human volunteers exposed to RF fields under a variety of exposure scenarios have provided supporting information on RF field induced thermal responses in humans (42). This information forms the scientific basis for the basic restrictions on whole-body average SAR in Safety Code 6. To ensure that thermal effects are avoided, safety factors have been incorporated into the exposure limits, resulting in whole-body-averaged SAR limits of 0.08 and 0.4 W/kg in uncontrolled- and controlled-environments, respectively. Basic restrictions on peak spatially-averaged SAR have also been established in Safety Code 6 to avoid adverse thermal effects in localized human tissues (hot-spots). The peak spatially-averaged SAR limits reflect the highly heterogeneous nature of typical RF field exposures and the differing thermoregulatory properties of various body tissues. The peak spatially-averaged SAR limits pertain to discrete tissue volumes (1 or 10 g, in the shape of a cube), where thermoregulation can efficiently dissipate heat and avoid changes in body temperature that are greater than 1°C. As such, the peak spatially-averaged SAR limits for exposures in controlled environments are 20 W/kg for the limbs and 8 W/kg for the head, neck and trunk. For exposures in uncontrolled environments, the peak spatially-averaged SAR limits are 4.0 W/kg for the limbs and 1.6 W/kg for the head, neck and trunk. For frequencies from 100 kHz to 10 MHz, since either NS or thermal effects could occur, depending upon the exposure conditions (frequency, duty cycle, orientation), basic restrictions for both internal electric field strength and SAR (whole-body and peak spatially-averaged) must be simultaneously respected. Safety Code 6 also specifies reference levels in the 3 kHz to 110 MHz frequency range, in terms of induced- or contact-currents (mA), for the avoidance of perception (nerve stimulation), shocks or burns (4, 6). While the biological basis for the basic restrictions specified in this safety code has not changed since the previous version (2009), the reference levels have been updated to either account for dosimetric refinements in recent years (43-64) or where feasible, to harmonize with those of ICNIRP (10-11). To determine whether the maximum exposure levels are exceeded, full consideration shall be given to such factors as: Where comparison is to be made to the SAR-based basic restrictions and/or reference levels at frequencies in the 100 kHz - 300 GHz range, higher exposure levels may be permitted for short durations of time under certain circumstances. For these situations, the field strengths, power densities and body currents averaged over any one tenth-hour reference period (6 minutes) shall not exceed the limits outlined in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. SI units are used throughout this document unless specified otherwise. Limits for internal electric field strength are intended to prevent the occurrence of NS. At frequencies between 3 kHz and 10 MHz, basic restrictions for internal electric field strength in excitable tissues (Table 1) shall not be exceeded. For conditions where the determination of internal electric field strength is not possible or practical (e.g. by measurement or modelling), external unperturbed field strength assessment shall be carried out and the reference levels outlined in Section 2.2 shall be respected. The SAR is a measure of the rate at which electromagnetic energy is absorbed in the body. Basic restrictions for SAR are intended to prevent the occurrence of thermal effects from RF energy exposure on the body. At frequencies between 100 kHz and 6 GHz, the SAR limits (Table 2) take precedence over field strength and power density reference levels (Section 2.2) and shall not be exceeded. The SAR should be determined for situations where exposures occur at a distance of 0.2 m or less from the source. In all cases, the values in Table 2 shall not be exceeded. For conditions where SAR determination is impractical, external unperturbed field strength or power density measurements shall be carried out and the limits outlined in Section 2.2 shall be respected. Table 2 footnotes Defined as a tissue volume in the shape of a cube. Return to the first table 2 footnote 1 referrer Averaged over any 6 minute reference period. Return to table 2 footnote 2 referrer For frequencies above 6 GHz, energy deposition occurs predominantly in the uppermost layers of superficial tissues (e.g. skin, cornea). In this case, power density is a more appropriate exposure limit metric. Therefore, for the frequency range from 6 GHz to 300 GHz, the incident unperturbed power density and its derived electric- and magnetic-field strengths (assuming a free-space impedance of 377 ohms) form the basic restriction in this safety code (Section 2.2.2) and shall not be exceeded. In practice, direct measurements of internal electric fields or SAR are often only feasible under laboratory conditions. Therefore, reference levels are specified in this safety code in terms of external unperturbed electric and magnetic field strength, power density, as well as induced and contact currents. In the far-field zone of an electromagnetic source, electric field strength, magnetic field strength and power density are interrelated by simple mathematical expressions, where any one of these parameters defines the remaining two. In the near-field zone, both the unperturbed electric- and magnetic-field strengths shall be measured, since there is no simple relationship between these two quantities. Instrumentation for the measurement of magnetic fields at certain frequencies may not be commercially available. In this case, the electric field strength shall be measured and used for assessing compliance with the reference levels in this code. To ensure compliance with the basic restrictions outlined in Section 2.1, at frequencies between 0.003 MHz and 10 MHz, both the NS- and SAR-based reference levels for electric- and magnetic-field strength must be complied with simultaneously at frequencies where reference levels for both apply. Frequency, f, is in MHz. The precise frequencies at which SAR-based electric field strength reference levels for Uncontrolled and Controlled Environments begin are 1.10 MHz and 1.29 MHz, respectively. Table 3 footnotes At no point in time shall the RMS values for electric fields exceed the reference levels with an instantaneous reference period. In the case of RF fields with amplitude modulation, the RMS value during the maximum of the modulation envelope shall be compared to the reference level. Return to table 3 footnote 1 referrer For exposures shorter than the reference period, field strengths may exceed the reference levels, provided that the time average of the squared value of the electric field strength over any time period equal to the reference period shall not exceed ERL2.

Return to table 4 footnote 2 referrer Notes for Tables 3 and 4: To ensure compliance with the basic restrictions outlined in Section 2.1, at frequencies between 10 MHz and 300 GHz, the reference levels for electric- and magnetic-field strength and power density must be complied with. Notes for Tables 5 and 6: Induced current is defined as the current flowing through a single foot to ground in a free-standing body (no contact with conductive objects) exposed to an electric field. Where assessment is made of the current flowing through both feet, the result shall be compared to twice the reference level for a single foot. Contact current is defined as the total current flowing through the body to ground resulting from finger-touch contact with a conductive object insulated from the ground that has been energized in an electric field. Conversely, it can be defined as the total current flowing in an insulated body that has been energized in an electric field and is in finger-touch contact with a grounded conductive object. The current path in the body is from point of touch to ground through the feet. The total current can be assessed anywhere along the path of flow. Frequency, f, is in MHz. Table 7 footnotes At no point in time shall the RMS values for induced currents exceed the reference levels with an instantaneous reference period. In the case of currents with amplitude modulation, the RMS value during the maximum of the modulation envelope shall be compared to the reference level.

					 Biology Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for biology researchers, academics, and students. It only takes a minute to sign up. Teams Q&A for work Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search. The human ear (for example) is sensitive to frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz. Any sound beyond that limit would not be heard by us naturally. Will it harm us (effect our ability to hear) when we hear sound more than 20kHz continuously? Or... Will it harm when we hear a 19,999Hz sound (which is upper limit) continuously? The only sensible answer to these questions is "sometimes".  The reason: even a simple monotone must be described by both frequency and amplitude. Any frequency can cause harm with enough amplitude, and any frequency can be harmless when the amplitude is low enough. If you want to actually quantify the damage, you'll need something like an equal-loudness curve, but for damage rather than loudness. As a proxy, you could use the pain threshold of the equal-loudness curve.  As for the second question, there is nothing magical about 20kHz: physical damage will always fall on a spectrum, there is no single frequency and/or amplitude at which damage begins. If you set an oscillator to constant amplitude and slowly turn up the frequency, you'll notice that the sound slowly dies out around 20kHz. The damage threshold will behave the same way.  If you are talking about sound damaging the sound sensing organs in the ear, analogous to an ultrasonic heavy metal concert, I've found an interesting report just on this topic. For ultrasonic components above 20 kHz, the limits were set to avoid hearing damage in the audible (lower) frequencies. One-third-octave band levels of 105-115 dB were observed to produce no temporary hearing loss, and were therefore judged non-hazardous in respect of permanent hearing damage. If you are talking about high frequency sound from a explosion, or some sort of sonic cutter with intensities of such a level of compression or a high decibel range that conveys enough energy to physically damage something of course the answer would be 'yes this would damage your ears and the rest of the body too. Operators of ultrasonic equipment with levels above 60 dB complained of headaches and fatigue, even nausea below 60 dB they felt no effect (reference table 7 in paper).  But they did not seem to have any hearing loss. One soviet experiment is both informative and maybe also entertaining to read about: An unspecified number of subjects were exposed for an hour to a tone of 20 kHz at 110 dB. Tests were made to examine shift of hearing threshold over the frequency range 250 Hz to 10 kHz. Pulse rate, body temperature and skin temperature were also monitored. These tests showed no appreciable effect, even when the Sound Pressure Level was increased to 115 dB. These same subjects were given a one hour exposure to a 5 kHz tone at 90 dB: a considerable TTS was found. The 5 kHz tone at 110 dB produced a powerful vascular response. ...

This is the conclusion of a study from the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. The study shows that being exposed to inaudible sounds for only 90 seconds can have an effect on the inner ear.  Human beings are normally able to detect sounds in the range of 20-20,000 Hz and it is well known that sounds within this range can damage the hearing. However, sounds under the frequency of 20 Hz can also affect the ear even though we are unable to hear them.  The German study was conducted on 21 volunteers who were placed in sound proof booths. The volunteers were exposed to a frequency of 30 Hz for 90 seconds. After this, the activity in their ears was recorded.

 The activity of the ears was measured from faint whistling sounds that are constantly being emitted from the human ear. The phenomenon is called spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, SOAEs. The whistling sounds cannot be picked up by the human ear and were detected with a microphone. The researchers found that after being exposed to low frequency sounds for 90 seconds, the whistling sounds or SOAEs changed.  The SOAEs became temporarily stronger or weaker, which tells the researchers that sounds can be harmful even though we are not able to hear them.   According to researcher of the study, neurobiologist Markus Drexl, the results do not indicate that exposure to sounds with low frequencies leads directly to hearing loss, but it makes the ear more prone to being damaged. The study was published in Royal Society Open Science.  Source: http://news.sciencemag.org

                    Sounds that cannot be heard (inaudible) at lower frequencies have not been considered harmful to the ear, but this may not be the case. This is the conclusion of a study from the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. The study shows that being exposed to inaudible sounds for only 90 seconds can have an effect on the inner ear.  Human beings are normally able to detect sounds in the range of 20-20,000 Hz and it is well known that sounds within this range can damage the hearing. However, sounds under the frequency of 20 Hz can also affect the ear even though we are unable to hear them.  The German study was conducted on 21 volunteers who were placed in sound proof booths. The volunteers were exposed to a frequency of 30 Hz for 90 seconds. After this, the activity in their ears was recorded.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Electric fields are created by differences in voltage: the higher the voltage, the stronger will be the resultant field. Magnetic fields are created when electric current flows: the greater the current, the stronger the magnetic field. An electric field will exist even when there is no current flowing. If current does flow, the strength of the magnetic field will vary with power consumption but the electric field strength will be constant.Natural sources of electromagnetic fieldsElectromagnetic fields are present everywhere in our environment but are invisible to the human eye. Electric fields are produced by the local build-up of electric charges in the atmosphere associated with thunderstorms. The earth's magnetic field causes a compass needle to orient in a North-South direction and is used by birds and fish for navigation.Human-made sources of electromagnetic fieldsBesides natural sources the electromagnetic spectrum also includes fields generated by human-made sources: X-rays are employed to diagnose a broken limb after a sport accident. The electricity that comes out of every power socket has associated low frequency electromagnetic fields. And various kinds of higher frequency radiowaves are used to transmit information – whether via TV antennas, radio stations or mobile phone base stations.

One of the main characteristics which defines an electromagnetic field (EMF) is its frequency or its corresponding wavelength. Fields of different frequencies interact with the body in different ways. One can imagine electromagnetic waves as series of very regular waves that travel at an enormous speed, the speed of light. The frequency simply describes the number of oscillations or cycles per second, while the term wavelength describes the distance between one wave and the next. Hence wavelength and frequency are inseparably intertwined: the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength.A simple analogy should help to illustrate the concept: Tie a long rope to a door handle and keep hold of the free end. Moving it up and then down slowly will generate a single big wave; more rapid motion will generate a whole series of small waves. The length of the rope remains constant, therefore, the more waves you generate (higher frequency) the smaller will be the distance between them (shorter wavelength).

 Exposure to electromagnetic fields is not a new phenomenon. However, during the 20th century, environmental exposure to artificial electromagnetic fields has been steadily increasing as growing electricity demand, ever-advancing technologies and changes in social behaviour have created more and more artificial sources. Everyone is exposed to a complex mix of weak electric and magnetic fields, both at home and at work, from the generation and transmission of electricity, domestic appliances and industrial equipment, to telecommunications and broadcasting.Tiny electrical currents exist in the human body due to the chemical reactions that occur as part of the normal bodily functions, even in the absence of external electric fields. For example, nerves relay signals by transmitting electric impulses. Most biochemical reactions from digestion to brain activities go along with the rearrangement of charged particles. Even the heart is electrically active - an activity that your doctor can trace with the help of an electrocardiogram.Low-frequency electric fields influence the human body just as they influence any other material made up of charged particles. When electric fields act on conductive materials, they influence the distribution of electric charges at their surface. They cause current to flow through the body to the ground.Low-frequency magnetic fields induce circulating currents within the human body. The strength of these currents depends on the intensity of the outside magnetic field. If sufficiently large, these currents could cause stimulation of nerves and muscles or affect other biological processes.Both electric and magnetic fields induce voltages and currents in the body but even directly beneath a high voltage transmission line, the induced currents are very small compared to thresholds for producing shock and other electrical effects.Heating is the main biological effect of the electromagnetic fields of radiofrequency fields. In microwave ovens this fact is employed to warm up food. The levels of radiofrequency fields to which people are normally exposed are very much lower than those needed to produce significant heating. The heating effect of radiowaves forms the underlying basis for current guidelines. Scientists are also investigating the possibility that effects below the threshold level for body heating occur as a result of long-term exposure. To date, no adverse health effects from low level, long-term exposure to radiofrequency or power frequency fields have been confirmed, but scientists are actively continuing to research this area.

Biological effects are measurable responses to a stimulus or to a change in the environment. These changes are not necessarily harmful to your health. For example, listening to music, reading a book, eating an apple or playing tennis will produce a range of biological effects. Nevertheless, none of these activities is expected to cause health effects. The body has sophisticated mechanisms to adjust to the many and varied influences we encounter in our environment. Ongoing change forms a normal part of our lives. But, of course, the body does not possess adequate compensation mechanisms for all biological effects. Changes that are irreversible and stress the system for long periods of time may constitute a health hazard.An adverse health effect causes detectable impairment of the health of the exposed individual or of his or her offspring; a biological effect, on the other hand, may or may not result in an adverse health effect.It is not disputed that electromagnetic fields above certain levels can trigger biological effects. Experiments with healthy volunteers indicate that short-term exposure at the levels present in the environment or in the home do not cause any apparent detrimental effects. Exposures to higher levels that might be harmful are restricted by national and international guidelines. The current debate is centred on whether long-term low level exposure can evoke biological responses and influence people's well being.Widespread concerns for healthA look at the news headlines of recent years allows some insight into the various areas of public concern. Over the course of the past decade, numerous electromagnetic field sources have become the focus of health concerns, including power lines, microwave ovens, computer and TV screens, security devices, radars and most recently mobile phones and their base stations.The International EMF ProjectIn response to growing public health concerns over possible health effects from exposure to an ever increasing number and diversity of electromagnetic field sources, in 1996 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a large, multidisciplinary research effort. The International EMF Project brings together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions.Conclusions from scientific researchIn the area of biological effects and medical applications of non-ionizing radiation approximately 25,000 articles have been published over the past 30 years. Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research.Effects on general healthSome members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home. Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido. To date, scientific evidence does not support a link between these symptoms and exposure to electromagnetic fields. At least some of these health problems may be caused by noise or other factors in the environment, or by anxiety related to the presence of new technologies.Effects on pregnancy outcomeMany different sources and exposures to electromagnetic fields in the living and working environment, including computer screens, water beds and electric blankets, radiofrequency welding machines, diathermy equipment and radar, have been evaluated by the WHO and other organizations. The overall weight of evidence shows that exposure to fields at typical environmental levels does not increase the risk of any adverse outcome such as spontaneous abortions, malformations, low birth weight, and congenital diseases. There have been occasional reports of associations between health problems and presumed exposure to electromagnetic fields, such as reports of prematurity and low birth weight in children of workers in the electronics industry, but these have not been regarded by the scientific community as being necessarily caused by the field exposures (as opposed to factors such as exposure to solvents).CataractsGeneral eye irritation and cataracts have sometimes been reported in workers exposed to high levels of radiofrequency and microwave radiation, but animal studies do not support the idea that such forms of eye damage can be produced at levels that are not thermally hazardous. There is no evidence that these effects occur at levels experienced by the general public.Electromagnetic fields and cancerDespite many studies, the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults.A number of epidemiological studies suggest small increases in risk of childhood leukemia with exposure to low frequency magnetic fields in the home. However, scientists have not generally concluded that these results indicate a cause-effect relation between exposure to the fields and disease (as opposed to artifacts in the study or effects unrelated to field exposure). In part, this conclusion has been reached because animal and laboratory studies fail to demonstrate any reproducible effects that are consistent with the hypothesis that fields cause or promote cancer. Large-scale studies are currently underway in several countries and may help resolve these issues.Electromagnetic hypersensitivity and depressionSome individuals report "hypersensitivity" to electric or magnetic fields. They ask whether aches and pains, headaches, depression, lethargy, sleeping disorders, and even convulsions and epileptic seizures could be associated with electromagnetic field exposure.There is little scientific evidence to support the idea of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Recent Scandinavian studies found that individuals do not show consistent reactions under properly controlled conditions of electromagnetic field exposure. Nor is there any accepted biological mechanism to explain hypersensitivity. Research on this subject is difficult because many other subjective responses may be involved, apart from direct effects of fields themselves. More studies are continuing on the subject.The focus of current and future researchMuch effort is currently being directed towards the study of electromagnetic fields in relation to cancer. Studies in search for possible carcinogenic (cancer-producing) effects of power frequency fields is continuing, although at a reduced level compared to that of the late 1990's.The long-term health effects of mobile telephone use is another topic of much current research. No obvious adverse effect of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields has been discovered. However, given public concerns regarding the safety of cellular telephones, further research aims to determine whether any less obvious effects might occur at very low exposure levels.Key pointsA wide range of environmental influences causes biological effects. 'Biological effect' does not equal 'health hazard'. Special research is needed to identify and measure health hazards.At low frequencies, external electric and magnetic fields induce small circulating currents within the body. In virtually all ordinary environments, the levels of induced currents inside the body are too small to produce obvious effects.The main effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is heating of body tissues.There is no doubt that short-term exposure to very high levels of electromagnetic fields can be harmful to health. Current public concern focuses on possible long-term health effects caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below those required to trigger acute biological responses.WHO's International EMF Project was launched to provide scientifically sound and objective answers to public concerns about possible hazards of low level electromagnetic fields.Despite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health.The focus of international research is the investigation of possible links between cancer and electromagnetic fields, at power line and radiofrequencies.

However, given public concerns regarding the safety of cellular telephones, further research aims to determine whether any less obvious effects might occur at very low exposure levels.    
If electromagnetic fields constitute a health hazard, there will be consequences in all industrialized countries. The public demands concrete answers to the ever more pressing question, whether everyday electromagnetic fields cause adverse health effects. The media often seem to have definitive answers. However, one should judge these reports with caution and take into account that the primary interest of the media is not education. A journalist may select and report a story driven by a range of non-technical reasons: journalists compete with one another for time and space and different journals and newspapers compete for circulation numbers. Novel sensational headlines that are relevant to as many people as possible aid them in achieving these goals - bad news is not only the big news, it is often the only news we hear. The large number of studies which suggest that electromagnetic fields are harmless receive little if any coverage. Science cannot provide a guarantee of absolute safety yet but the development of research is reassuring overall.Different types of studies are neededA mix of studies in different research areas is essential for the evaluation of a potential adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields. Different types of studies investigate distinct aspects of the problem. Laboratory studies on cells aim to elucidate the fundamental underlying mechanisms that link electromagnetic field exposure to biological effects. They try to identify mechanisms based on molecular or cellular changes that are brought about by the electromagnetic field - such a change would provide clues to how a physical force is converted into a biological action within the body. In these studies, single cells or tissues are removed from their normal living environment which may inactivate possible compensation mechanisms.Another type of study, involving animals, is more closely related to real life situations. These studies provide evidence that is more directly relevant to establishing safe exposure levels in humans and often employ several different field levels to investigate dose-response relationships.Epidemiological studies or human health studies are another direct source of information on long-term effects of exposure. These studies investigate the cause and distribution of diseases in real life situations, in communities and occupational groups. Researchers try to establish if there is a statistical association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the incidence of a specific disease or adverse health effect. However, epidemiological studies are costly. More importantly, they involve measurements on very complex human populations and are difficult to control sufficiently well to detect small effects. For these reasons, scientists evaluate all relevant evidence when deciding about potential health hazards, including epidemiology, animal, and cellular studies.Interpretation of epidemiological studiesEpidemiological studies alone typically cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship, mainly because they detect only statistical associations between exposure and disease, which may or may not be caused by the exposure. Imagine a hypothetical study showing a link between electromagnetic field exposure in electrical workers of the company "X-Electricity" and an increased risk of cancer. Even if a statistical association is observed, it could also be due to incomplete data on other factors in the workplace. For example, electrical workers may have been exposed to chemical solvents with the potential to cause cancer. Moreover, an observed statistical association may be due only to statistical effects, or the study itself may have suffered from some problem with its design.Therefore, finding an association between some agent and a specific disease does not necessarily mean that the agent caused the disease. Establishing causality requires that an investigator consider many factors. The case for a cause-and-effect link is strengthened if there is a consistent and strong association between exposure and effect, a clear dose-response relationship, a credible biological explanation, support provided by relevant animal studies, and above all consistency between studies. These factors have generally been absent in studies involving electromagnetic fields and cancer. This is one of the strongest reasons why scientists have generally been reluctant to conclude that weak electromagnetic fields have health effects.Difficulties in ruling out the possibility of very small risks"The absence of evidence of detrimental effects does not seem to suffice in modern society. The evidence of their absence is demanded more and more instead". (Barnabas Kunsch, Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf)"There is no convincing evidence for an adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields" or "A cause-effect link between electromagnetic fields and cancer has not been confirmed" are typical of the conclusions that have been reached by expert committees that have examined the issue. This sounds as if science wanted to avoid giving an answer. Then why should research continue if scientists have already shown that there is no effect?The answer is simple: Human health studies are very good at identifying large effects, such as a connection between smoking and cancer. Unfortunately, they are less able to distinguish a small effect from no effect at all. If electromagnetic fields at typical environmental levels were strong carcinogens, then it would have been easy to have shown that by now. By contrast, if low level electromagnetic fields are a weak carcinogen, or even a strong carcinogen to a small group of people in the larger population, that would be far more difficult to demonstrate. In fact, even if a large study shows no association we can never be entirely sure that there is no relationship. The absence of an effect could mean that there really is none. But just as well it could mean that the effect is simply undetectable with our method of measurement. Therefore, negative results are generally less convincing than strong positive ones.The most difficult situation of all, which unfortunately has developed with epidemiology studies involving electromagnetic fields, is a collection of studies with weak positive results, which however are inconsistent among each other. In that situation, scientists themselves are likely to be divided about the significance of the data. However, for the reasons explained above, most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life.What's in the future?The main aim of WHO's International EMF Project is to initiate and co-ordinate research worldwide to produce a well-founded response to public concerns. This evaluation will integrate results from cellular, animal and human health studies to allow as comprehensive a health risk assessment as possible. A holistic assessment of a variety of relevant and reliable studies will provide the most reliable answer possible about the adverse health effects, if any exist, of long term exposure to weak electromagnetic fields.One way to illustrate the necessity of evidence from different types of experiments is a crossword. To be able to read the given crossword's solution with absolute CERTAINTY nine questions must be answered. Assuming we can only answer three of these, we might be able to guess the solution. However, the three given letters may also be part of a very different word. Every additional answer will increase our own confidence. In fact, science will probably never be able to answer all questions, but the more solid evidence we collect the better will be our guess at the solution.Key pointsLaboratory studies on cells aim to determine if there is a mechanism by which electromagnetic field exposure could cause harmful biological effects. Animal studies are essential for establishing effects in higher organisms whose physiology resembles that of humans to a degree. Epidemiological studies look for statistical associations between field exposure and the incidence of specific adverse health outcomes in humans.Finding a statistical association between some agent and a specific disease does not mean that the agent caused the disease.The absence of health effects could mean that there really are none; however, it could also signify that an existing effect is undetectable with present methods.Results of diverse studies (cellular, animal, and epidemiology) must be considered together before drawing conclusions about possible health risks of a suspected environmental hazard. Consistent evidence from these very different types of studies increases the degree of certainty about a true effect

A journalist may select and report a story driven by a range of non-technical reasons: journalists compete with one another for time and space and different journals and newspapers compete for circulation numbers. Novel sensational headlines that are relevant to as many people as possible aid them in achieving these goals - bad news is not only the big news, it is often the only news we hear. The large number of studies which suggest that electromagnetic fields are harmless receive little if any coverage. Science cannot provide a guarantee of absolute safety yet but the development of research is reassuring overall. A mix of studies in different research areas is essential for the evaluation of a potential adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields. Different types of studies investigate distinct aspects of the problem. Laboratory studies on cells aim to elucidate the fundamental underlying mechanisms that link electromagnetic field exposure to biological effects. They try to identify mechanisms based on molecular or cellular changes that are brought about by the electromagnetic field - such a change would provide clues to how a physical force is converted into a biological action within the body. In these studies, single cells or tissues are removed from their normal living environment which may inactivate possible compensation mechanisms. Another type of study, involving animals, is more closely related to real life situations. These studies provide evidence that is more directly relevant to establishing safe exposure levels in humans and often employ several different field levels to investigate dose-response relationships. Epidemiological studies or human health studies are another direct source of information on long-term effects of exposure. These studies investigate the cause and distribution of diseases in real life situations, in communities and occupational groups. Researchers try to establish if there is a statistical association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the incidence of a specific disease or adverse health effect. However, epidemiological studies are costly. More importantly, they involve measurements on very complex human populations and are difficult to control sufficiently well to detect small effects. For these reasons, scientists evaluate all relevant evidence when deciding about potential health hazards, including epidemiology, animal, and cellular studies. Epidemiological studies alone typically cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship, mainly because they detect only statistical associations between exposure and disease, which may or may not be caused by the exposure. Imagine a hypothetical study showing a link between electromagnetic field exposure in electrical workers of the company "X-Electricity" and an increased risk of cancer. Even if a statistical association is observed, it could also be due to incomplete data on other factors in the workplace. For example, electrical workers may have been exposed to chemical solvents with the potential to cause cancer. Moreover, an observed statistical association may be due only to statistical effects, or the study itself may have suffered from some problem with its design. Therefore, finding an association between some agent and a specific disease does not necessarily mean that the agent caused the disease. Establishing causality requires that an investigator consider many factors. The case for a cause-and-effect link is strengthened if there is a consistent and strong association between exposure and effect, a clear dose-response relationship, a credible biological explanation, support provided by relevant animal studies, and above all consistency between studies. These factors have generally been absent in studies involving electromagnetic fields and cancer. This is one of the strongest reasons why scientists have generally been reluctant to conclude that weak electromagnetic fields have health effects. "The absence of evidence of detrimental effects does not seem to suffice in modern society. The evidence of their absence is demanded more and more instead". (Barnabas Kunsch, Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf) "There is no convincing evidence for an adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields" or "A cause-effect link between electromagnetic fields and cancer has not been confirmed" are typical of the conclusions that have been reached by expert committees that have examined the issue. This sounds as if science wanted to avoid giving an answer. Then why should research continue if scientists have already shown that there is no effect? The answer is simple: Human health studies are very good at identifying large effects, such as a connection between smoking and cancer. Unfortunately, they are less able to distinguish a small effect from no effect at all. If electromagnetic fields at typical environmental levels were strong carcinogens, then it would have been easy to have shown that by now. By contrast, if low level electromagnetic fields are a weak carcinogen, or even a strong carcinogen to a small group of people in the larger population, that would be far more difficult to demonstrate. In fact, even if a large study shows no association we can never be entirely sure that there is no relationship. The absence of an effect could mean that there really is none. But just as well it could mean that the effect is simply undetectable with our method of measurement. Therefore, negative results are generally less convincing than strong positive ones. The most difficult situation of all, which unfortunately has developed with epidemiology studies involving electromagnetic fields, is a collection of studies with weak positive results, which however are inconsistent among each other. In that situation, scientists themselves are likely to be divided about the significance of the data. However, for the reasons explained above, most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life. The main aim of WHO's International EMF Project is to initiate and co-ordinate research worldwide to produce a well-founded response to public concerns. This evaluation will integrate results from cellular, animal and human health studies to allow as comprehensive a health risk assessment as possible. A holistic assessment of a variety of relevant and reliable studies will provide the most reliable answer possible about the adverse health effects, if any exist, of long term exposure to weak electromagnetic fields. One way to illustrate the necessity of evidence from different types of experiments is a crossword. To be able to read the given crossword's solution with absolute CERTAINTY nine questions must be answered. Assuming we can only answer three of these, we might be able to guess the solution. However, the three given letters may also be part of a very different word. Every additional answer will increase our own confidence. In fact, science will probably never be able to answer all questions, but the more solid evidence we collect the better will be our guess at the solution.   
Electromagnetic fields at homeBackground electromagnetic field levels from electricity transmission and distribution facilitiesElectricity is transmitted over long distances via high voltage power lines. Transformers reduce these high voltages for local distribution to homes and businesses. Electricity transmission and distribution facilities and residential wiring and appliances
account for the background level of power frequency electric and magnetic fields in the home. In homes not located near power lines this background field may be up to about 0.2 µT. Directly beneath power lines the fields are much stronger. Magnetic
flux densities at ground level can range up to several µT. Electric field levels underneath power lines can be as high as 10 kV/m. However, the fields (both electric and magnetic) drop off with distance from the lines. At 50 m to 100 m distance
the fields are normally at levels that are found in areas away from high voltage power lines. In addition, house walls substantially reduce the electric field levels from those found at similar locations outside the house.Electric appliances in the householdThe strongest power frequency electric fields that are ordinarily encountered in the environment exist beneath high voltage transmission lines. In contrast, the strongest magnetic fields at power frequency are normally found very close to motors and other
electrical appliances, as well as in specialized equipment such as magnetic resonance scanners used for medical imaging.Typical electric field strengths measured near household appliances(at a distance of 30 cm)(From: Federal Office for Radiation Safety, Germany 1999)Electric applianceElectric field strength (V/m)Stereo receiver180Iron120Refrigerator120Mixer100Toaster80Hair dryer80Colour TV60Coffee machine60Vacuum cleaner50Electric oven8Light bulb5  Guideline limit value5000Many people are surprised when they become aware of the variety of magnetic field levels found near various appliances. The field strength does not depend on how large, complex, powerful or noisy the device is. Furthermore, even between apparently
similar devices, the strength of the magnetic field may vary a lot. For example, while some hair dryers are surrounded by a very strong field, others hardly produce any magnetic field at all. These differences in magnetic field strength are related
to product design. The following table shows typical values for a number of electrical devices commonly found in homes and workplaces. The measurements were taken in Germany and all of the appliances operate on electricity at a frequency of 50
Hz. It should be noted that the actual exposure levels vary considerably depending on the model of appliance and distance from it.Typical magnetic field strength of household appliances at various distancesElectric appliance3 cm distance (µT)

The table illustrates two main points: First, the magnetic field strength around all appliances rapidly decreases the further you get away from them. Secondly, most household appliances are not operated very close to the body. At a distance of 30
cm the magnetic fields surrounding most household appliances are more than 100 times lower than the given guideline limit of 100 µT at 50 Hz (83 µT at 60 Hz) for the general public.Television sets and computer screensComputer screens and television sets work on similar principles. Both produce static electric fields and alternating electric and magnetic fields at various frequencies. However, screens with liquid crystal displays used in some laptop computers and
desktop units do not give rise to significant electric and magnetic fields. Modern computers have conductive screens which reduce the static field from the screen to a level similar to that of the normal background in the home or workplace. At
the position of operators (30 to 50 cm from the screen), alternating magnetic fields are typically below 0.7 µT in flux density (at power frequencies). Alternating electric field strengths at operator positions range from below 1 V/m up
to 10 V/m.Microwave ovensDomestic microwave ovens operate at very high power levels. However, effective shielding reduces leakage outside the ovens to almost non-detectable levels. Furthermore microwave leakage falls very rapidly with increasing distance from the oven. Many
countries have manufacturing standards that specify maximum leakage levels for new ovens; an oven that meets the manufacturing standards will not present any hazard to the consumer.Portable telephonesPortable telephones operate at much lower intensities than mobile phones. This is because they are employed very close to their home base station, and so do not need strong fields to transmit over long distances. As a consequence, the radiofrequency
fields that surround these devices are negligible.Electromagnetic fields in the environmentRadarRadars are used for navigation, weather forecasting, and military applications, as well as a variety of other functions. They emit pulsed microwave signals. The peak power in the pulse can be high even though the average power may
be low. Many radars rotate or move up and down; this reduces the mean power density to which the public is exposed in the vicinity of radars. Even high power, non-rotating military radars limit exposures to below guideline levels at locations
of public access.Security systemsAnti-theft systems in shops use tags that are detected by electrical coils at the exits. When a purchase is made the tags are removed or permanently deactivated. The electromagnetic fields from the coils do not generally exceed exposure guideline
levels. Access control systems work in the same way with the tag incorporated into a key ring or identity card. Library security systems use tags that can be deactivated when a book is borrowed and reactivated when it is returned. Metal detectors
and airport security systems set up a strong magnetic field of up to 100 µT that is disturbed by the presence of a metal object. Close to the frame of the detector, magnetic field strengths may approach and occasionally exceed guideline
levels. However, this does not constitute a health hazard, as will be discussed in the section on guidelines. (see Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?)Electric trains and tramsLong-distance trains have one or more engine cars that are separate from the passenger cars. Thus passenger exposure comes mainly from the electricity supply to the train. Magnetic fields in the passenger cars of long-distance trains can be several
hundred µT near the floor, with lower values (tens of µT) elsewhere in the compartment. Electric field strengths may reach 300 V/m. People living in the vicinity of railway lines may encounter magnetic fields from the overhead supply
which, depending on the country, may be comparable to the fields produced by high-voltage power lines.Motors and traction equipment of trains and trams are normally located underneath the floors of passenger cars. At floor level, magnetic field intensities may amount to tens of µT in regions of the floor just above the motor. The fields fall
off quickly with distance from the floor, and exposure of the upper bodies of passengers is much lower.TV and radioWhen choosing a radio station on your stereo at home, have you ever wondered what the familiar abbreviations AM and FM stand for? Radio signals are described as amplitude-modulated (AM) or frequency-modulated (FM) depending on the way in which they
carry information. AM radio signals can be used for broadcasting over very long distances whereas FM waves cover more localized areas but can give a better sound quality.AM radio signals are transmitted via large arrays of antennas, which can be tens of metres high, on sites which are off-limits to the public. Exposures very close to antennas and feed cables can be high, but these would affect maintenance workers
rather than the general public.TV and FM radio antennas are much smaller than AM radio antennas and are mounted in arrays at the top of high towers. The towers themselves serve only as supporting structures. As exposures near the foot of these towers are below guideline limits,
public access to these areas may be possible. Small local TV and radio antennas are sometimes mounted on the top of buildings; if this is the case it may be necessary to control access to the roof.Mobile phones and their base stationsMobile phones allow people to be within reach at all times. These low-power radiowave devices transmit and receive signals from a network of fixed low power base stations. Each base station provides coverage to a given area. Depending on the number
of calls being handled, base stations may be from only a few hundred metres apart in major cities to several kilometres apart in rural areas.Mobile phone base stations are usually mounted on the tops of buildings or on towers at heights of between 15 and 50 metres. The levels of transmissions from any particular base station are variable and depend on the number of calls and the callers'
distance from the base station. Antennas emit a very narrow beam of radiowaves which spreads out almost parallel to the ground. Therefore, radiofrequency fields at ground level and in regions normally accessible to the public are many times below
hazard levels. Guidelines would only be exceeded if a person were to approach to within a metre or two directly in front of the antennas. Until mobile phones became widely used, members of the public were mainly exposed to radiofrequency emissions
from radio and TV stations. Even today, the phone towers themselves add little to our total exposure, as signal strengths in places of public access are normally similar to or lower than those from distant radio and TV stations.However, the user of a mobile phone is exposed to radiofrequency fields much higher than those found in the general environment. Mobile phones are operated very close to the head. Therefore, rather than looking at the heating effect across the whole
body, the distribution of absorbed energy in the head of the user must be determined. From sophisticated computer modeling and measurements using models of heads, it appears that the energy absorbed from a mobile phone is not in excess of current
guidelines.
Concerns about other so-called non-thermal effects arising from exposure to mobile phone frequencies have also been raised. These include suggestions of subtle effects on cells that could have an effect on cancer development. Effects on electrically
excitable tissues that may influence the function of the brain and nervous tissue have also been hypothesized. However, the overall evidence available to date does not suggest that the use of mobile phones has any detrimental effect on human health.Magnetic fields in everyday life: are they really that high?In recent years, national authorities in different countries have conducted many measurements to investigate electromagnetic field levels in the living environment. None of these surveys has concluded that field levels could bring about adverse health
effects.
The Federal Office for Radiation Safety in Germany recently measured the daily exposure to magnetic fields of about 2000 individuals across a range of occupations and public exposures. All of them were equipped with personal dosimeters for 24 hours.
The measured exposure varied widely but gave an average daily exposure of 0.10 µT. This value is a thousand times lower that the standard limit of 100 µT for the public and five thousand times lower than the 500 µT exposure limit
for workers. Furthermore, the exposure of people living in the centres of cities showed that there are no drastic differences in exposure between life in rural areas and life in the city. Even the exposure of people living in the vicinity of high
voltage power lines differs very little from the average exposure in the population.Key pointsBackground electromagnetic field levels in the home are mainly caused by the transmission and distribution facilities for electricity or by electrical appliances.Electrical appliances differ greatly in the strength of fields they generate. Both electric and magnetic field levels decrease rapidly with distance from the appliances. In any event, fields surrounding household appliances usually are far below
guideline limits.At operator positions the electric and magnetic fields of television sets and computer screens are hundreds of thousands times below guideline levels.Microwave ovens meeting the standards are not hazardous to health.As long as close public access to radar facilities, broadcasting antennas and mobile phone base stations is restricted, exposure guideline limits for radiofrequency fields will not be exceeded.The user of a mobile phone encounters field levels that are much higher than any levels in the normal living environment. However, even these increased levels do not appear to generate harmful effects.Many surveys have demonstrated that exposure to electromagnetic field levels in the living environment is extremely low.
 Electricity is transmitted over long distances via high voltage power lines. Transformers reduce these high voltages for local distribution to homes and businesses. Electricity transmission and distribution facilities and residential wiring and appliances

Standards are set to protect our health and are well known for many food additives, for concentrations of chemicals in water or air pollutants. Similarly, field standards exist to limit overexposure to electromagnetic field levels present in our environment.Who decides on guidelines?Countries set their own national standards for exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, the majority of these national standards draw on the guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). This non-governmental organization, formally recognized by WHO, evaluates scientific results from all over the world. Based on an in-depth review of the literature, ICNIRP produces guidelines recommending limits on exposure. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and updated if necessary.Electromagnetic field levels vary with frequency in a complex way. Listing every value in every standard and at every frequency would be difficult to understand. The table below is a summary of the exposure guidelines for the three areas that have become the focus of public concern: electricity in the home, mobile phone base stations and microwave ovens. These guidelines were last updated in April 1998.Summary of the ICNIRP exposure guidelines European power frequencyMobile phone base station frequencyMicrowave oven frequencyFrequency50 Hz50 Hz900 MHz1.8 GHz2.45 GHz Electric field (V/m)Magnetic field (µT)Power density (W/m2)Power density (W/m2)Power density (W/m2)Public exposure limits5 0001004.5910Occupational exposure limits10 00050022.545 ICNIRP, EMF guidelines, Health Physics 74, 494-522 (1998)The exposure guidelines may differ by a factor of more than 100 between some former Soviet countries and Western countries. With the globalization of trade and the rapid introduction of telecommunications worldwide there is a need for universal standards. As many countries from the former Soviet Union are now considering new standards, the WHO has recently launched an initiative to harmonize exposure guidelines worldwide. Future standards will be based on the results of the WHO's International Electromagnetic Field Project.What are guidelines based on?An important point to make is that a guideline limit is not a precise delineation between safety and hazard. There is no one level above which exposures become hazardous to health; instead, the potential risk to human health gradually increases with higher exposure levels. Guidelines indicate that, below a given threshold, electromagnetic field exposure is safe according to scientific knowledge. However, it does not automatically follow that, above the given limit, exposure is harmful.Nevertheless, to be able to set limits on exposure, scientific studies need to identify the threshold level at which first health effects become apparent. As humans cannot be used for experiments, guidelines critically rely on animal studies. Subtle behavioural changes in animals at low levels often precede more drastic changes in health at higher levels. Abnormal behaviour is a very sensitive indicator of a biological response and has been selected as the lowest observable adverse health effect. Guidelines recommend the prevention of electromagnetic field exposure levels, at which behavioural changes become noticeable.This threshold level for behaviour is not equal to the guideline limit. ICNIRP applies a safety factor of 10 to derive occupational exposure limits, and a factor of 50 to obtain the guideline value for the general public. Therefore, for example, in the radiofrequency and microwave frequency ranges, the maximum levels you might experience in the environment or in your home are at least 50 times lower than the threshold level at which first behavioural changes in animals become apparent.Why is the safety factor for occupational exposure guidelines lower than for the general public?The occupationally exposed population consists of adults who generally experience known electromagnetic field conditions. These workers are trained to be aware of potential risk and to take appropriate precautions. By contrast, the general public consists of individuals of all ages and of varying health status. In many cases, these are unaware of their exposure to EMF. Moreover, individual members of the public cannot be expected to take precautions to minimize or avoid exposure. These are the underlying considerations for more stringent exposure restrictions for the general public than for the occupationally exposed population.As we have seen earlier, low frequency electromagnetic fields induce currents in the human body (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). But various biochemical reactions within the body itself generate currents as well. The cells or tissues will not be able to detect any induced currents below this background level. Therefore, at low frequencies, exposure guidelines ensure that the level of currents induced by an electromagnetic fields is below that of natural body currents.The main effect of radiofrequency energy is the heating of tissue. Consequently, exposure guidelines for radiofrequency fields and microwaves are set to prevent health effects caused by localized or whole-body heating (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). Compliance with the guidelines will ensure that heating effects are sufficiently small not to be harmful.What guidelines cannot account forAt present, speculations about potential long-term health effects cannot form the basis for the issuing of guidelines or standards. Adding up the results of all scientific studies, the overall weight of evidence does not indicate that electromagnetic fields cause long-term health effects such as cancer. National and international bodies set and update standards on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge to protect against known health effects.Guidelines are set for the average population and cannot directly address the requirements of a minority of potentially more sensitive people. Air pollution guidelines, for example, are not based on the special needs of asthmatics. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines are not designed to protect people from interference with implanted medical electronic devices such as heart pacemakers. Instead, advice about exposure situations to be avoided should be sought from the manufacturers and from the clinician implanting the device.What are typical maximum exposure levels at home and in the environment?Some practical information will help you to relate to the international guideline values given above. In the following table you will find the most common sources of electromagnetic fields. All values are maximum levels of public exposure – your own exposure is likely to be much lower. For a closer look at field levels around individual electrical appliances, please see the section Typical exposure levels at home and in the environment.SourceTypical maximum public exposureElectric field (V/m)Magnetic flux density (µT)Natural fields20070 (Earth's magnetic field)Mains power(in homes not close to power lines)1000.2Mains power(beneath large power lines)10 00020Electric trains and trams30050TV and computer screens(at operator position)100.7 Typical maximum public exposure (W/m2)TV and radio transmitters0.1Mobile phone base stations0.1Radars0.2Microwave ovens0.5Source: WHO Regional Office for EuropeHow are guidelines put into practice and who checks on them?The responsibility to investigate fields around power lines, mobile phone base stations or any other sources accessible to the general public lies with government agencies and local authorities. They must ensure that compliance with guidelines is maintained.With electronic devices, the manufacturer is responsible for complying with the standard limits. However, as we have seen above, the nature of most devices ensures that the emitted fields are well below the cut-off values. Furthermore, many consumer associations carry out tests on a regular basis. In case of any particular concern or worry, contact the manufacturer directly or enquire with your local public health authority.Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?It is perfectly safe to eat a pot of strawberry jam up to the expiration date – but if you consume the jam any later the manufacturer cannot guarantee good food quality. Nevertheless, even a few weeks or months after the expiration date, it will usually be safe to eat the jam. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines ensure that, within the given exposure limit, no known adverse health effects will occur. A large safety factor is applied to the level known to cause a health consequence. Therefore, even if you experienced field strengths several times higher than the given limit value, your exposure would still be within this safety margin.In everyday situations, most people do not experience electromagnetic fields that exceed the guideline limits. Typical exposures are far below these values. However, there are occasions where a person's exposure may, for a short period, approach or even exceed the guidelines. According to ICNIRP, radiofrequency and microwave exposures should be averaged over time to address cumulative effects. The guidelines specify a time-averaging period of six minutes and short-term exposures above the limits are acceptable.In contrast, exposure to low frequency electric and magnetic fields is not time-averaged in the guidelines. To make things even more complicated, another factor called coupling comes into play. Coupling refers to the interaction between the electric and magnetic fields and the exposed body. This depends on the size and shape of the body, the type of tissue and the orientation of the body relative to the field. Guidelines must be conservative: ICNIRP always assumes maximum coupling of the field to the exposed individual. Thus the guideline limits provide maximum protection. For example, even though the magnetic field values for hairdryers and electric shavers appear to exceed the recommended values, extremely weak coupling between the field and the head prevents the induction of electrical currents that could exceed guideline limits.Key pointsICNIRP issues guidelines on the basis of the current scientific knowledge. Most countries draw on these international guidelines for their own national standards.Standards for low frequency electromagnetic fields ensure that induced electric currents are below the normal level of background currents within the body. Standards for radiofrequency and microwaves prevent health effects caused by localized or whole body heating.Guidelines do not protect against potential interference with electromedical devices.Maximum exposure levels in everyday life are typically far below guideline limits.Due to a large safety factor, exposure above the guideline limits is not necessarily harmful to health. Furthermore time-averaging for high frequency fields and the assumption of maximum coupling for low frequency fields introduce an additional safety margin.
 Standards are set to protect our health and are well known for many food additives, for concentrations of chemicals in water or air pollutants. Similarly, field standards exist to limit overexposure to electromagnetic field levels present in our environment. Countries set their own national standards for exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, the majority of these national standards draw on the guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). This non-governmental organization, formally recognized by WHO, evaluates scientific results from all over the world. Based on an in-depth review of the literature, ICNIRP produces guidelines recommending limits on exposure. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and updated if necessary. Electromagnetic field levels vary with frequency in a complex way. Listing every value in every standard and at every frequency would be difficult to understand. The table below is a summary of the exposure guidelines for the three areas that have become the focus of public concern: electricity in the home, mobile phone base stations and microwave ovens. These guidelines were last updated in April 1998. Summary of the ICNIRP exposure guidelines European power frequency Mobile phone base station frequency Microwave oven frequency Frequency 50 Hz 50 Hz 900 MHz 1.8 GHz 2.45 GHz Electric field (V/m) Magnetic field (µT) Power density (W/m2) Power density (W/m2) Power density (W/m2) Public exposure limits 5 000 100 4.5 9 10 Occupational exposure limits 10 000 500 22.5 45 ICNIRP, EMF guidelines, Health Physics 74, 494-522 (1998) The exposure guidelines may differ by a factor of more than 100 between some former Soviet countries and Western countries. With the globalization of trade and the rapid introduction of telecommunications worldwide there is a need for universal standards. As many countries from the former Soviet Union are now considering new standards, the WHO has recently launched an initiative to harmonize exposure guidelines worldwide. Future standards will be based on the results of the WHO's International Electromagnetic Field Project. An important point to make is that a guideline limit is not a precise delineation between safety and hazard. There is no one level above which exposures become hazardous to health; instead, the potential risk to human health gradually increases with higher exposure levels. Guidelines indicate that, below a given threshold, electromagnetic field exposure is safe according to scientific knowledge. However, it does not automatically follow that, above the given limit, exposure is harmful. Nevertheless, to be able to set limits on exposure, scientific studies need to identify the threshold level at which first health effects become apparent. As humans cannot be used for experiments, guidelines critically rely on animal studies. Subtle behavioural changes in animals at low levels often precede more drastic changes in health at higher levels. Abnormal behaviour is a very sensitive indicator of a biological response and has been selected as the lowest observable adverse health effect. Guidelines recommend the prevention of electromagnetic field exposure levels, at which behavioural changes become noticeable. This threshold level for behaviour is not equal to the guideline limit. ICNIRP applies a safety factor of 10 to derive occupational exposure limits, and a factor of 50 to obtain the guideline value for the general public. Therefore, for example, in the radiofrequency and microwave frequency ranges, the maximum levels you might experience in the environment or in your home are at least 50 times lower than the threshold level at which first behavioural changes in animals become apparent. The occupationally exposed population consists of adults who generally experience known electromagnetic field conditions. These workers are trained to be aware of potential risk and to take appropriate precautions. By contrast, the general public consists of individuals of all ages and of varying health status. In many cases, these are unaware of their exposure to EMF. Moreover, individual members of the public cannot be expected to take precautions to minimize or avoid exposure. These are the underlying considerations for more stringent exposure restrictions for the general public than for the occupationally exposed population. As we have seen earlier, low frequency electromagnetic fields induce currents in the human body (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). But various biochemical reactions within the body itself generate currents as well. The cells or tissues will not be able to detect any induced currents below this background level. Therefore, at low frequencies, exposure guidelines ensure that the level of currents induced by an electromagnetic fields is below that of natural body currents. The main effect of radiofrequency energy is the heating of tissue. Consequently, exposure guidelines for radiofrequency fields and microwaves are set to prevent health effects caused by localized or whole-body heating (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). Compliance with the guidelines will ensure that heating effects are sufficiently small not to be harmful. At present, speculations about potential long-term health effects cannot form the basis for the issuing of guidelines or standards.

With more and more research data available, it has become increasingly unlikely that exposure to electromagnetic fields constitutes a serious health hazard, nevertheless, some uncertainty remains. The original scientific discussion about the interpretation of controversial results has shifted to become a societal as well as political issue.The public debate over electromagnetic fields focuses on the potential detriments of electromagnetic fields but often ignores the benefits associated with electromagnetic field technology. Without electricity, society would come to a standstill. Similarly, broadcasting and telecommunications have become a simple fact of modern life. An analysis of the balance between cost and potential hazards is essential.Protection of public healthInternational guidelines and national safety standards for electromagnetic fields are developed on the basis of the current scientific knowledge to ensure that the fields humans encounter are not harmful to health. To compensate uncertainties in knowledge (due, for example, to experimental errors, extrapolation from animals to humans, or statistical uncertainty), large safety factors are incorporated into the exposure limits. The guidelines are regularly reviewed and updated if necessary. It has been suggested that taking additional precautions to cope with remaining uncertainties may be a useful policy to adopt while science improves knowledge on health consequences. However, the type and extent of the cautionary policy chosen critically depends on the strength of evidence for a health risk and the scale and nature of the potential consequences. The cautionary response should be proportional to the potential risk. For more information, see the WHO Backgrounder on Cautionary Policies.Several policies promoting caution have been developed to address concerns about public, occupational and environmental health and safety issues connected with chemical and physical agents.What should be done while research continues?One of the objectives of the International EMF Project is to help national authorities weigh the benefits of using electromagnetic field technologies against the possibility that a health risk might be discovered. Furthermore, the WHO will issue recommendations on protective measures, if they may be needed. It will take some years for the required research to be completed, evaluated and published. In the meantime, the World Health Organization has issued a series of recommendations:Strict adherence to existing national or international safety standards: such standards, based on current knowledge, are developed to protect everyone in the population with a large safety factor.Simple protective measures: barriers around strong electromagnetic field sources help preclude unauthorized access to areas where exposure limits may be exceeded.Consultation with local authorities and the public in siting new power lines or mobile phone base stations: siting decisions are often required to take into account aesthetics and public sensitivities. Open communication during the planning stages can help create public understanding and greater acceptance of a new facility.Communication: an effective system of health information and communication among scientists, governments, industry and the public can help raise general awareness of programmes dealing with exposure to electromagnetic fields and reduce any mistrust and fears.For further information, see the WHO Fact Sheets on Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health.

                    Electric fields are created by differences in voltage: the higher the voltage, the stronger will be the resultant field. Magnetic fields are created when electric current flows: the greater the current, the stronger the magnetic field. An electric field will exist even when there is no current flowing. If current does flow, the strength of the magnetic field will vary with power consumption but the electric field strength will be constant.Natural sources of electromagnetic fieldsElectromagnetic fields are present everywhere in our environment but are invisible to the human eye. Electric fields are produced by the local build-up of electric charges in the atmosphere associated with thunderstorms. The earth&#x27;s magnetic field causes a compass needle to orient in a North-South direction and is used by birds and fish for navigation.Human-made sources of electromagnetic fieldsBesides natural sources the electromagnetic spectrum also includes fields generated by human-made sources: X-rays are employed to diagnose a broken limb after a sport accident. The electricity that comes out of every power socket has associated low frequency electromagnetic fields. And various kinds of higher frequency radiowaves are used to transmit information – whether via TV antennas, radio stations or mobile phone base stations.

One of the main characteristics which defines an electromagnetic field (EMF) is its frequency or its corresponding wavelength. Fields of different frequencies interact with the body in different ways. One can imagine electromagnetic waves as series of very regular waves that travel at an enormous speed, the speed of light. The frequency simply describes the number of oscillations or cycles per second, while the term wavelength describes the distance between one wave and the next. Hence wavelength and frequency are inseparably intertwined: the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength.A simple analogy should help to illustrate the concept: Tie a long rope to a door handle and keep hold of the free end. Moving it up and then down slowly will generate a single big wave; more rapid motion will generate a whole series of small waves. The length of the rope remains constant, therefore, the more waves you generate (higher frequency) the smaller will be the distance between them (shorter wavelength).

 Exposure to electromagnetic fields is not a new phenomenon. However, during the 20th century, environmental exposure to artificial electromagnetic fields has been steadily increasing as growing electricity demand, ever-advancing technologies and changes in social behaviour have created more and more artificial sources. Everyone is exposed to a complex mix of weak electric and magnetic fields, both at home and at work, from the generation and transmission of electricity, domestic appliances and industrial equipment, to telecommunications and broadcasting.Tiny electrical currents exist in the human body due to the chemical reactions that occur as part of the normal bodily functions, even in the absence of external electric fields. For example, nerves relay signals by transmitting electric impulses. Most biochemical reactions from digestion to brain activities go along with the rearrangement of charged particles. Even the heart is electrically active - an activity that your doctor can trace with the help of an electrocardiogram.Low-frequency electric fields influence the human body just as they influence any other material made up of charged particles. When electric fields act on conductive materials, they influence the distribution of electric charges at their surface. They cause current to flow through the body to the ground.Low-frequency magnetic fields induce circulating currents within the human body. The strength of these currents depends on the intensity of the outside magnetic field. If sufficiently large, these currents could cause stimulation of nerves and muscles or affect other biological processes.Both electric and magnetic fields induce voltages and currents in the body but even directly beneath a high voltage transmission line, the induced currents are very small compared to thresholds for producing shock and other electrical effects.Heating is the main biological effect of the electromagnetic fields of radiofrequency fields. In microwave ovens this fact is employed to warm up food. The levels of radiofrequency fields to which people are normally exposed are very much lower than those needed to produce significant heating. The heating effect of radiowaves forms the underlying basis for current guidelines. Scientists are also investigating the possibility that effects below the threshold level for body heating occur as a result of long-term exposure. To date, no adverse health effects from low level, long-term exposure to radiofrequency or power frequency fields have been confirmed, but scientists are actively continuing to research this area.

Biological effects are measurable responses to a stimulus or to a change in the environment. These changes are not necessarily harmful to your health. For example, listening to music, reading a book, eating an apple or playing tennis will produce a range of biological effects. Nevertheless, none of these activities is expected to cause health effects. The body has sophisticated mechanisms to adjust to the many and varied influences we encounter in our environment. Ongoing change forms a normal part of our lives. But, of course, the body does not possess adequate compensation mechanisms for all biological effects. Changes that are irreversible and stress the system for long periods of time may constitute a health hazard.An adverse health effect causes detectable impairment of the health of the exposed individual or of his or her offspring; a biological effect, on the other hand, may or may not result in an adverse health effect.It is not disputed that electromagnetic fields above certain levels can trigger biological effects. Experiments with healthy volunteers indicate that short-term exposure at the levels present in the environment or in the home do not cause any apparent detrimental effects. Exposures to higher levels that might be harmful are restricted by national and international guidelines. The current debate is centred on whether long-term low level exposure can evoke biological responses and influence people&#x27;s well being.Widespread concerns for healthA look at the news headlines of recent years allows some insight into the various areas of public concern. Over the course of the past decade, numerous electromagnetic field sources have become the focus of health concerns, including power lines, microwave ovens, computer and TV screens, security devices, radars and most recently mobile phones and their base stations.The International EMF ProjectIn response to growing public health concerns over possible health effects from exposure to an ever increasing number and diversity of electromagnetic field sources, in 1996 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a large, multidisciplinary research effort. The International EMF Project brings together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions.Conclusions from scientific researchIn the area of biological effects and medical applications of non-ionizing radiation approximately 25,000 articles have been published over the past 30 years. Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research.Effects on general healthSome members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home. Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido. To date, scientific evidence does not support a link between these symptoms and exposure to electromagnetic fields. At least some of these health problems may be caused by noise or other factors in the environment, or by anxiety related to the presence of new technologies.Effects on pregnancy outcomeMany different sources and exposures to electromagnetic fields in the living and working environment, including computer screens, water beds and electric blankets, radiofrequency welding machines, diathermy equipment and radar, have been evaluated by the WHO and other organizations. The overall weight of evidence shows that exposure to fields at typical environmental levels does not increase the risk of any adverse outcome such as spontaneous abortions, malformations, low birth weight, and congenital diseases. There have been occasional reports of associations between health problems and presumed exposure to electromagnetic fields, such as reports of prematurity and low birth weight in children of workers in the electronics industry, but these have not been regarded by the scientific community as being necessarily caused by the field exposures (as opposed to factors such as exposure to solvents).CataractsGeneral eye irritation and cataracts have sometimes been reported in workers exposed to high levels of radiofrequency and microwave radiation, but animal studies do not support the idea that such forms of eye damage can be produced at levels that are not thermally hazardous. There is no evidence that these effects occur at levels experienced by the general public.Electromagnetic fields and cancerDespite many studies, the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults.A number of epidemiological studies suggest small increases in risk of childhood leukemia with exposure to low frequency magnetic fields in the home. However, scientists have not generally concluded that these results indicate a cause-effect relation between exposure to the fields and disease (as opposed to artifacts in the study or effects unrelated to field exposure). In part, this conclusion has been reached because animal and laboratory studies fail to demonstrate any reproducible effects that are consistent with the hypothesis that fields cause or promote cancer. Large-scale studies are currently underway in several countries and may help resolve these issues.Electromagnetic hypersensitivity and depressionSome individuals report &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; to electric or magnetic fields. They ask whether aches and pains, headaches, depression, lethargy, sleeping disorders, and even convulsions and epileptic seizures could be associated with electromagnetic field exposure.There is little scientific evidence to support the idea of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Recent Scandinavian studies found that individuals do not show consistent reactions under properly controlled conditions of electromagnetic field exposure. Nor is there any accepted biological mechanism to explain hypersensitivity. Research on this subject is difficult because many other subjective responses may be involved, apart from direct effects of fields themselves. More studies are continuing on the subject.The focus of current and future researchMuch effort is currently being directed towards the study of electromagnetic fields in relation to cancer. Studies in search for possible carcinogenic (cancer-producing) effects of power frequency fields is continuing, although at a reduced level compared to that of the late 1990&#x27;s.The long-term health effects of mobile telephone use is another topic of much current research. No obvious adverse effect of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields has been discovered. However, given public concerns regarding the safety of cellular telephones, further research aims to determine whether any less obvious effects might occur at very low exposure levels.Key pointsA wide range of environmental influences causes biological effects. &#x27;Biological effect&#x27; does not equal &#x27;health hazard&#x27;. Special research is needed to identify and measure health hazards.At low frequencies, external electric and magnetic fields induce small circulating currents within the body. In virtually all ordinary environments, the levels of induced currents inside the body are too small to produce obvious effects.The main effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is heating of body tissues.There is no doubt that short-term exposure to very high levels of electromagnetic fields can be harmful to health. Current public concern focuses on possible long-term health effects caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below those required to trigger acute biological responses.WHO&#x27;s International EMF Project was launched to provide scientifically sound and objective answers to public concerns about possible hazards of low level electromagnetic fields.Despite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health.The focus of international research is the investigation of possible links between cancer and electromagnetic fields, at power line and radiofrequencies.

Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research. Some members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home. Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido. To date, scientific evidence does not support a link between these symptoms and exposure to electromagnetic fields. At least some of these health problems may be caused by noise or other factors in the environment, or by anxiety related to the presence of new technologies. Many different sources and exposures to electromagnetic fields in the living and working environment, including computer screens, water beds and electric blankets, radiofrequency welding machines, diathermy equipment and radar, have been evaluated by the WHO and other organizations. The overall weight of evidence shows that exposure to fields at typical environmental levels does not increase the risk of any adverse outcome such as spontaneous abortions, malformations, low birth weight, and congenital diseases. There have been occasional reports of associations between health problems and presumed exposure to electromagnetic fields, such as reports of prematurity and low birth weight in children of workers in the electronics industry, but these have not been regarded by the scientific community as being necessarily caused by the field exposures (as opposed to factors such as exposure to solvents). General eye irritation and cataracts have sometimes been reported in workers exposed to high levels of radiofrequency and microwave radiation, but animal studies do not support the idea that such forms of eye damage can be produced at levels that are not thermally hazardous. There is no evidence that these effects occur at levels experienced by the general public. Despite many studies, the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults. A number of epidemiological studies suggest small increases in risk of childhood leukemia with exposure to low frequency magnetic fields in the home. However, scientists have not generally concluded that these results indicate a cause-effect relation between exposure to the fields and disease (as opposed to artifacts in the study or effects unrelated to field exposure). In part, this conclusion has been reached because animal and laboratory studies fail to demonstrate any reproducible effects that are consistent with the hypothesis that fields cause or promote cancer. Large-scale studies are currently underway in several countries and may help resolve these issues. Some individuals report &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; to electric or magnetic fields. They ask whether aches and pains, headaches, depression, lethargy, sleeping disorders, and even convulsions and epileptic seizures could be associated with electromagnetic field exposure. There is little scientific evidence to support the idea of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Recent Scandinavian studies found that individuals do not show consistent reactions under properly controlled conditions of electromagnetic field exposure. Nor is there any accepted biological mechanism to explain hypersensitivity. Research on this subject is difficult because many other subjective responses may be involved, apart from direct effects of fields themselves. More studies are continuing on the subject. Much effort is currently being directed towards the study of electromagnetic fields in relation to cancer. Studies in search for possible carcinogenic (cancer-producing) effects of power frequency fields is continuing, although at a reduced level compared to that of the late 1990&#x27;s. The long-term health effects of mobile telephone use is another topic of much current research. No obvious adverse effect of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields has been discovered. However, given public concerns regarding the safety of cellular telephones, further research aims to determine whether any less obvious effects might occur at very low exposure levels.    
If electromagnetic fields constitute a health hazard, there will be consequences in all industrialized countries. The public demands concrete answers to the ever more pressing question, whether everyday electromagnetic fields cause adverse health effects. The media often seem to have definitive answers. However, one should judge these reports with caution and take into account that the primary interest of the media is not education. A journalist may select and report a story driven by a range of non-technical reasons: journalists compete with one another for time and space and different journals and newspapers compete for circulation numbers. Novel sensational headlines that are relevant to as many people as possible aid them in achieving these goals - bad news is not only the big news, it is often the only news we hear. The large number of studies which suggest that electromagnetic fields are harmless receive little if any coverage. Science cannot provide a guarantee of absolute safety yet but the development of research is reassuring overall.Different types of studies are neededA mix of studies in different research areas is essential for the evaluation of a potential adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields. Different types of studies investigate distinct aspects of the problem. Laboratory studies on cells aim to elucidate the fundamental underlying mechanisms that link electromagnetic field exposure to biological effects. They try to identify mechanisms based on molecular or cellular changes that are brought about by the electromagnetic field - such a change would provide clues to how a physical force is converted into a biological action within the body. In these studies, single cells or tissues are removed from their normal living environment which may inactivate possible compensation mechanisms.Another type of study, involving animals, is more closely related to real life situations. These studies provide evidence that is more directly relevant to establishing safe exposure levels in humans and often employ several different field levels to investigate dose-response relationships.Epidemiological studies or human health studies are another direct source of information on long-term effects of exposure. These studies investigate the cause and distribution of diseases in real life situations, in communities and occupational groups. Researchers try to establish if there is a statistical association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the incidence of a specific disease or adverse health effect. However, epidemiological studies are costly. More importantly, they involve measurements on very complex human populations and are difficult to control sufficiently well to detect small effects. For these reasons, scientists evaluate all relevant evidence when deciding about potential health hazards, including epidemiology, animal, and cellular studies.Interpretation of epidemiological studiesEpidemiological studies alone typically cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship, mainly because they detect only statistical associations between exposure and disease, which may or may not be caused by the exposure. Imagine a hypothetical study showing a link between electromagnetic field exposure in electrical workers of the company &quot;X-Electricity&quot; and an increased risk of cancer. Even if a statistical association is observed, it could also be due to incomplete data on other factors in the workplace. For example, electrical workers may have been exposed to chemical solvents with the potential to cause cancer. Moreover, an observed statistical association may be due only to statistical effects, or the study itself may have suffered from some problem with its design.Therefore, finding an association between some agent and a specific disease does not necessarily mean that the agent caused the disease. Establishing causality requires that an investigator consider many factors. The case for a cause-and-effect link is strengthened if there is a consistent and strong association between exposure and effect, a clear dose-response relationship, a credible biological explanation, support provided by relevant animal studies, and above all consistency between studies. These factors have generally been absent in studies involving electromagnetic fields and cancer. This is one of the strongest reasons why scientists have generally been reluctant to conclude that weak electromagnetic fields have health effects.Difficulties in ruling out the possibility of very small risks&quot;The absence of evidence of detrimental effects does not seem to suffice in modern society. The evidence of their absence is demanded more and more instead&quot;. (Barnabas Kunsch, Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf)&quot;There is no convincing evidence for an adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields&quot; or &quot;A cause-effect link between electromagnetic fields and cancer has not been confirmed&quot; are typical of the conclusions that have been reached by expert committees that have examined the issue. This sounds as if science wanted to avoid giving an answer. Then why should research continue if scientists have already shown that there is no effect?The answer is simple: Human health studies are very good at identifying large effects, such as a connection between smoking and cancer. Unfortunately, they are less able to distinguish a small effect from no effect at all. If electromagnetic fields at typical environmental levels were strong carcinogens, then it would have been easy to have shown that by now. By contrast, if low level electromagnetic fields are a weak carcinogen, or even a strong carcinogen to a small group of people in the larger population, that would be far more difficult to demonstrate. In fact, even if a large study shows no association we can never be entirely sure that there is no relationship. The absence of an effect could mean that there really is none. But just as well it could mean that the effect is simply undetectable with our method of measurement. Therefore, negative results are generally less convincing than strong positive ones.The most difficult situation of all, which unfortunately has developed with epidemiology studies involving electromagnetic fields, is a collection of studies with weak positive results, which however are inconsistent among each other. In that situation, scientists themselves are likely to be divided about the significance of the data. However, for the reasons explained above, most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life.What&#x27;s in the future?The main aim of WHO&#x27;s International EMF Project is to initiate and co-ordinate research worldwide to produce a well-founded response to public concerns. This evaluation will integrate results from cellular, animal and human health studies to allow as comprehensive a health risk assessment as possible. A holistic assessment of a variety of relevant and reliable studies will provide the most reliable answer possible about the adverse health effects, if any exist, of long term exposure to weak electromagnetic fields.One way to illustrate the necessity of evidence from different types of experiments is a crossword. To be able to read the given crossword&#x27;s solution with absolute CERTAINTY nine questions must be answered. Assuming we can only answer three of these, we might be able to guess the solution. However, the three given letters may also be part of a very different word. Every additional answer will increase our own confidence. In fact, science will probably never be able to answer all questions, but the more solid evidence we collect the better will be our guess at the solution.Key pointsLaboratory studies on cells aim to determine if there is a mechanism by which electromagnetic field exposure could cause harmful biological effects. Animal studies are essential for establishing effects in higher organisms whose physiology resembles that of humans to a degree. Epidemiological studies look for statistical associations between field exposure and the incidence of specific adverse health outcomes in humans.Finding a statistical association between some agent and a specific disease does not mean that the agent caused the disease.The absence of health effects could mean that there really are none; however, it could also signify that an existing effect is undetectable with present methods.Results of diverse studies (cellular, animal, and epidemiology) must be considered together before drawing conclusions about possible health risks of a suspected environmental hazard. Consistent evidence from these very different types of studies increases the degree of certainty about a true effect

Electromagnetic fields at homeBackground electromagnetic field levels from electricity transmission and distribution facilitiesElectricity is transmitted over long distances via high voltage power lines. Transformers reduce these high voltages for local distribution to homes and businesses. Electricity transmission and distribution facilities and residential wiring and appliances
account for the background level of power frequency electric and magnetic fields in the home. In homes not located near power lines this background field may be up to about 0.2 µT. Directly beneath power lines the fields are much stronger. Magnetic
flux densities at ground level can range up to several µT. Electric field levels underneath power lines can be as high as 10 kV/m. However, the fields (both electric and magnetic) drop off with distance from the lines. At 50 m to 100 m distance
the fields are normally at levels that are found in areas away from high voltage power lines. In addition, house walls substantially reduce the electric field levels from those found at similar locations outside the house.Electric appliances in the householdThe strongest power frequency electric fields that are ordinarily encountered in the environment exist beneath high voltage transmission lines. In contrast, the strongest magnetic fields at power frequency are normally found very close to motors and other
electrical appliances, as well as in specialized equipment such as magnetic resonance scanners used for medical imaging.Typical electric field strengths measured near household appliances(at a distance of 30 cm)(From: Federal Office for Radiation Safety, Germany 1999)Electric applianceElectric field strength (V/m)Stereo receiver180Iron120Refrigerator120Mixer100Toaster80Hair dryer80Colour TV60Coffee machine60Vacuum cleaner50Electric oven8Light bulb5  Guideline limit value5000Many people are surprised when they become aware of the variety of magnetic field levels found near various appliances. The field strength does not depend on how large, complex, powerful or noisy the device is. Furthermore, even between apparently
similar devices, the strength of the magnetic field may vary a lot. For example, while some hair dryers are surrounded by a very strong field, others hardly produce any magnetic field at all. These differences in magnetic field strength are related
to product design. The following table shows typical values for a number of electrical devices commonly found in homes and workplaces. The measurements were taken in Germany and all of the appliances operate on electricity at a frequency of 50
Hz. It should be noted that the actual exposure levels vary considerably depending on the model of appliance and distance from it.Typical magnetic field strength of household appliances at various distancesElectric appliance3 cm distance (µT)

The table illustrates two main points: First, the magnetic field strength around all appliances rapidly decreases the further you get away from them. Secondly, most household appliances are not operated very close to the body. At a distance of 30
cm the magnetic fields surrounding most household appliances are more than 100 times lower than the given guideline limit of 100 µT at 50 Hz (83 µT at 60 Hz) for the general public.Television sets and computer screensComputer screens and television sets work on similar principles. Both produce static electric fields and alternating electric and magnetic fields at various frequencies. However, screens with liquid crystal displays used in some laptop computers and
desktop units do not give rise to significant electric and magnetic fields. Modern computers have conductive screens which reduce the static field from the screen to a level similar to that of the normal background in the home or workplace. At
the position of operators (30 to 50 cm from the screen), alternating magnetic fields are typically below 0.7 µT in flux density (at power frequencies). Alternating electric field strengths at operator positions range from below 1 V/m up
to 10 V/m.Microwave ovensDomestic microwave ovens operate at very high power levels. However, effective shielding reduces leakage outside the ovens to almost non-detectable levels. Furthermore microwave leakage falls very rapidly with increasing distance from the oven. Many
countries have manufacturing standards that specify maximum leakage levels for new ovens; an oven that meets the manufacturing standards will not present any hazard to the consumer.Portable telephonesPortable telephones operate at much lower intensities than mobile phones. This is because they are employed very close to their home base station, and so do not need strong fields to transmit over long distances. As a consequence, the radiofrequency
fields that surround these devices are negligible.Electromagnetic fields in the environmentRadarRadars are used for navigation, weather forecasting, and military applications, as well as a variety of other functions. They emit pulsed microwave signals. The peak power in the pulse can be high even though the average power may
be low. Many radars rotate or move up and down; this reduces the mean power density to which the public is exposed in the vicinity of radars. Even high power, non-rotating military radars limit exposures to below guideline levels at locations
of public access.Security systemsAnti-theft systems in shops use tags that are detected by electrical coils at the exits. When a purchase is made the tags are removed or permanently deactivated. The electromagnetic fields from the coils do not generally exceed exposure guideline
levels. Access control systems work in the same way with the tag incorporated into a key ring or identity card. Library security systems use tags that can be deactivated when a book is borrowed and reactivated when it is returned. Metal detectors
and airport security systems set up a strong magnetic field of up to 100 µT that is disturbed by the presence of a metal object. Close to the frame of the detector, magnetic field strengths may approach and occasionally exceed guideline
levels. However, this does not constitute a health hazard, as will be discussed in the section on guidelines. (see Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?)Electric trains and tramsLong-distance trains have one or more engine cars that are separate from the passenger cars. Thus passenger exposure comes mainly from the electricity supply to the train. Magnetic fields in the passenger cars of long-distance trains can be several
hundred µT near the floor, with lower values (tens of µT) elsewhere in the compartment. Electric field strengths may reach 300 V/m. People living in the vicinity of railway lines may encounter magnetic fields from the overhead supply
which, depending on the country, may be comparable to the fields produced by high-voltage power lines.Motors and traction equipment of trains and trams are normally located underneath the floors of passenger cars. At floor level, magnetic field intensities may amount to tens of µT in regions of the floor just above the motor. The fields fall
off quickly with distance from the floor, and exposure of the upper bodies of passengers is much lower.TV and radioWhen choosing a radio station on your stereo at home, have you ever wondered what the familiar abbreviations AM and FM stand for? Radio signals are described as amplitude-modulated (AM) or frequency-modulated (FM) depending on the way in which they
carry information. AM radio signals can be used for broadcasting over very long distances whereas FM waves cover more localized areas but can give a better sound quality.AM radio signals are transmitted via large arrays of antennas, which can be tens of metres high, on sites which are off-limits to the public. Exposures very close to antennas and feed cables can be high, but these would affect maintenance workers
rather than the general public.TV and FM radio antennas are much smaller than AM radio antennas and are mounted in arrays at the top of high towers. The towers themselves serve only as supporting structures. As exposures near the foot of these towers are below guideline limits,
public access to these areas may be possible. Small local TV and radio antennas are sometimes mounted on the top of buildings; if this is the case it may be necessary to control access to the roof.Mobile phones and their base stationsMobile phones allow people to be within reach at all times. These low-power radiowave devices transmit and receive signals from a network of fixed low power base stations. Each base station provides coverage to a given area. Depending on the number
of calls being handled, base stations may be from only a few hundred metres apart in major cities to several kilometres apart in rural areas.Mobile phone base stations are usually mounted on the tops of buildings or on towers at heights of between 15 and 50 metres. The levels of transmissions from any particular base station are variable and depend on the number of calls and the callers&#x27;
distance from the base station. Antennas emit a very narrow beam of radiowaves which spreads out almost parallel to the ground. Therefore, radiofrequency fields at ground level and in regions normally accessible to the public are many times below
hazard levels. Guidelines would only be exceeded if a person were to approach to within a metre or two directly in front of the antennas. Until mobile phones became widely used, members of the public were mainly exposed to radiofrequency emissions
from radio and TV stations. Even today, the phone towers themselves add little to our total exposure, as signal strengths in places of public access are normally similar to or lower than those from distant radio and TV stations.However, the user of a mobile phone is exposed to radiofrequency fields much higher than those found in the general environment. Mobile phones are operated very close to the head. Therefore, rather than looking at the heating effect across the whole
body, the distribution of absorbed energy in the head of the user must be determined. From sophisticated computer modeling and measurements using models of heads, it appears that the energy absorbed from a mobile phone is not in excess of current
guidelines.
Concerns about other so-called non-thermal effects arising from exposure to mobile phone frequencies have also been raised. These include suggestions of subtle effects on cells that could have an effect on cancer development. Effects on electrically
excitable tissues that may influence the function of the brain and nervous tissue have also been hypothesized. However, the overall evidence available to date does not suggest that the use of mobile phones has any detrimental effect on human health.Magnetic fields in everyday life: are they really that high?In recent years, national authorities in different countries have conducted many measurements to investigate electromagnetic field levels in the living environment. None of these surveys has concluded that field levels could bring about adverse health
effects.
The Federal Office for Radiation Safety in Germany recently measured the daily exposure to magnetic fields of about 2000 individuals across a range of occupations and public exposures. All of them were equipped with personal dosimeters for 24 hours.
The measured exposure varied widely but gave an average daily exposure of 0.10 µT. This value is a thousand times lower that the standard limit of 100 µT for the public and five thousand times lower than the 500 µT exposure limit
for workers. Furthermore, the exposure of people living in the centres of cities showed that there are no drastic differences in exposure between life in rural areas and life in the city. Even the exposure of people living in the vicinity of high
voltage power lines differs very little from the average exposure in the population.Key pointsBackground electromagnetic field levels in the home are mainly caused by the transmission and distribution facilities for electricity or by electrical appliances.Electrical appliances differ greatly in the strength of fields they generate. Both electric and magnetic field levels decrease rapidly with distance from the appliances. In any event, fields surrounding household appliances usually are far below
guideline limits.At operator positions the electric and magnetic fields of television sets and computer screens are hundreds of thousands times below guideline levels.Microwave ovens meeting the standards are not hazardous to health.As long as close public access to radar facilities, broadcasting antennas and mobile phone base stations is restricted, exposure guideline limits for radiofrequency fields will not be exceeded.The user of a mobile phone encounters field levels that are much higher than any levels in the normal living environment. However, even these increased levels do not appear to generate harmful effects.Many surveys have demonstrated that exposure to electromagnetic field levels in the living environment is extremely low.
 Electricity is transmitted over long distances via high voltage power lines. Transformers reduce these high voltages for local distribution to homes and businesses. Electricity transmission and distribution facilities and residential wiring and appliances

countries have manufacturing standards that specify maximum leakage levels for new ovens; an oven that meets the manufacturing standards will not present any hazard to the consumer. Portable telephones operate at much lower intensities than mobile phones. This is because they are employed very close to their home base station, and so do not need strong fields to transmit over long distances. As a consequence, the radiofrequency
fields that surround these devices are negligible. Radars are used for navigation, weather forecasting, and military applications, as well as a variety of other functions. They emit pulsed microwave signals. The peak power in the pulse can be high even though the average power may
be low. Many radars rotate or move up and down; this reduces the mean power density to which the public is exposed in the vicinity of radars. Even high power, non-rotating military radars limit exposures to below guideline levels at locations
of public access. Anti-theft systems in shops use tags that are detected by electrical coils at the exits. When a purchase is made the tags are removed or permanently deactivated. The electromagnetic fields from the coils do not generally exceed exposure guideline
levels. Access control systems work in the same way with the tag incorporated into a key ring or identity card. Library security systems use tags that can be deactivated when a book is borrowed and reactivated when it is returned. Metal detectors
and airport security systems set up a strong magnetic field of up to 100 µT that is disturbed by the presence of a metal object. Close to the frame of the detector, magnetic field strengths may approach and occasionally exceed guideline
levels. However, this does not constitute a health hazard, as will be discussed in the section on guidelines. (see Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?) Long-distance trains have one or more engine cars that are separate from the passenger cars. Thus passenger exposure comes mainly from the electricity supply to the train. Magnetic fields in the passenger cars of long-distance trains can be several
hundred µT near the floor, with lower values (tens of µT) elsewhere in the compartment. Electric field strengths may reach 300 V/m. People living in the vicinity of railway lines may encounter magnetic fields from the overhead supply
which, depending on the country, may be comparable to the fields produced by high-voltage power lines. Motors and traction equipment of trains and trams are normally located underneath the floors of passenger cars. At floor level, magnetic field intensities may amount to tens of µT in regions of the floor just above the motor. The fields fall
off quickly with distance from the floor, and exposure of the upper bodies of passengers is much lower. When choosing a radio station on your stereo at home, have you ever wondered what the familiar abbreviations AM and FM stand for? Radio signals are described as amplitude-modulated (AM) or frequency-modulated (FM) depending on the way in which they
carry information. AM radio signals can be used for broadcasting over very long distances whereas FM waves cover more localized areas but can give a better sound quality. AM radio signals are transmitted via large arrays of antennas, which can be tens of metres high, on sites which are off-limits to the public. Exposures very close to antennas and feed cables can be high, but these would affect maintenance workers
rather than the general public. TV and FM radio antennas are much smaller than AM radio antennas and are mounted in arrays at the top of high towers. The towers themselves serve only as supporting structures. As exposures near the foot of these towers are below guideline limits,
public access to these areas may be possible. Small local TV and radio antennas are sometimes mounted on the top of buildings; if this is the case it may be necessary to control access to the roof. Mobile phones allow people to be within reach at all times. These low-power radiowave devices transmit and receive signals from a network of fixed low power base stations. Each base station provides coverage to a given area. Depending on the number
of calls being handled, base stations may be from only a few hundred metres apart in major cities to several kilometres apart in rural areas. Mobile phone base stations are usually mounted on the tops of buildings or on towers at heights of between 15 and 50 metres. The levels of transmissions from any particular base station are variable and depend on the number of calls and the callers&#x27;
distance from the base station. Antennas emit a very narrow beam of radiowaves which spreads out almost parallel to the ground. Therefore, radiofrequency fields at ground level and in regions normally accessible to the public are many times below
hazard levels. Guidelines would only be exceeded if a person were to approach to within a metre or two directly in front of the antennas. Until mobile phones became widely used, members of the public were mainly exposed to radiofrequency emissions
from radio and TV stations. Even today, the phone towers themselves add little to our total exposure, as signal strengths in places of public access are normally similar to or lower than those from distant radio and TV stations. However, the user of a mobile phone is exposed to radiofrequency fields much higher than those found in the general environment. Mobile phones are operated very close to the head. Therefore, rather than looking at the heating effect across the whole
body, the distribution of absorbed energy in the head of the user must be determined. From sophisticated computer modeling and measurements using models of heads, it appears that the energy absorbed from a mobile phone is not in excess of current
guidelines.
 Concerns about other so-called non-thermal effects arising from exposure to mobile phone frequencies have also been raised. These include suggestions of subtle effects on cells that could have an effect on cancer development. Effects on electrically
excitable tissues that may influence the function of the brain and nervous tissue have also been hypothesized. However, the overall evidence available to date does not suggest that the use of mobile phones has any detrimental effect on human health. In recent years, national authorities in different countries have conducted many measurements to investigate electromagnetic field levels in the living environment. None of these surveys has concluded that field levels could bring about adverse health
effects.
 The Federal Office for Radiation Safety in Germany recently measured the daily exposure to magnetic fields of about 2000 individuals across a range of occupations and public exposures. All of them were equipped with personal dosimeters for 24 hours.
The measured exposure varied widely but gave an average daily exposure of 0.10 µT. This value is a thousand times lower that the standard limit of 100 µT for the public and five thousand times lower than the 500 µT exposure limit
for workers. Furthermore, the exposure of people living in the centres of cities showed that there are no drastic differences in exposure between life in rural areas and life in the city. Even the exposure of people living in the vicinity of high
voltage power lines differs very little from the average exposure in the population. 
Standards are set to protect our health and are well known for many food additives, for concentrations of chemicals in water or air pollutants. Similarly, field standards exist to limit overexposure to electromagnetic field levels present in our environment.Who decides on guidelines?Countries set their own national standards for exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, the majority of these national standards draw on the guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). This non-governmental organization, formally recognized by WHO, evaluates scientific results from all over the world. Based on an in-depth review of the literature, ICNIRP produces guidelines recommending limits on exposure. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and updated if necessary.Electromagnetic field levels vary with frequency in a complex way. Listing every value in every standard and at every frequency would be difficult to understand. The table below is a summary of the exposure guidelines for the three areas that have become the focus of public concern: electricity in the home, mobile phone base stations and microwave ovens. These guidelines were last updated in April 1998.Summary of the ICNIRP exposure guidelines European power frequencyMobile phone base station frequencyMicrowave oven frequencyFrequency50 Hz50 Hz900 MHz1.8 GHz2.45 GHz Electric field (V/m)Magnetic field (µT)Power density (W/m2)Power density (W/m2)Power density (W/m2)Public exposure limits5 0001004.5910Occupational exposure limits10 00050022.545 ICNIRP, EMF guidelines, Health Physics 74, 494-522 (1998)The exposure guidelines may differ by a factor of more than 100 between some former Soviet countries and Western countries. With the globalization of trade and the rapid introduction of telecommunications worldwide there is a need for universal standards. As many countries from the former Soviet Union are now considering new standards, the WHO has recently launched an initiative to harmonize exposure guidelines worldwide. Future standards will be based on the results of the WHO&#x27;s International Electromagnetic Field Project.What are guidelines based on?An important point to make is that a guideline limit is not a precise delineation between safety and hazard. There is no one level above which exposures become hazardous to health; instead, the potential risk to human health gradually increases with higher exposure levels. Guidelines indicate that, below a given threshold, electromagnetic field exposure is safe according to scientific knowledge. However, it does not automatically follow that, above the given limit, exposure is harmful.Nevertheless, to be able to set limits on exposure, scientific studies need to identify the threshold level at which first health effects become apparent. As humans cannot be used for experiments, guidelines critically rely on animal studies. Subtle behavioural changes in animals at low levels often precede more drastic changes in health at higher levels. Abnormal behaviour is a very sensitive indicator of a biological response and has been selected as the lowest observable adverse health effect. Guidelines recommend the prevention of electromagnetic field exposure levels, at which behavioural changes become noticeable.This threshold level for behaviour is not equal to the guideline limit. ICNIRP applies a safety factor of 10 to derive occupational exposure limits, and a factor of 50 to obtain the guideline value for the general public. Therefore, for example, in the radiofrequency and microwave frequency ranges, the maximum levels you might experience in the environment or in your home are at least 50 times lower than the threshold level at which first behavioural changes in animals become apparent.Why is the safety factor for occupational exposure guidelines lower than for the general public?The occupationally exposed population consists of adults who generally experience known electromagnetic field conditions. These workers are trained to be aware of potential risk and to take appropriate precautions. By contrast, the general public consists of individuals of all ages and of varying health status. In many cases, these are unaware of their exposure to EMF. Moreover, individual members of the public cannot be expected to take precautions to minimize or avoid exposure. These are the underlying considerations for more stringent exposure restrictions for the general public than for the occupationally exposed population.As we have seen earlier, low frequency electromagnetic fields induce currents in the human body (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). But various biochemical reactions within the body itself generate currents as well. The cells or tissues will not be able to detect any induced currents below this background level. Therefore, at low frequencies, exposure guidelines ensure that the level of currents induced by an electromagnetic fields is below that of natural body currents.The main effect of radiofrequency energy is the heating of tissue. Consequently, exposure guidelines for radiofrequency fields and microwaves are set to prevent health effects caused by localized or whole-body heating (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). Compliance with the guidelines will ensure that heating effects are sufficiently small not to be harmful.What guidelines cannot account forAt present, speculations about potential long-term health effects cannot form the basis for the issuing of guidelines or standards. Adding up the results of all scientific studies, the overall weight of evidence does not indicate that electromagnetic fields cause long-term health effects such as cancer. National and international bodies set and update standards on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge to protect against known health effects.Guidelines are set for the average population and cannot directly address the requirements of a minority of potentially more sensitive people. Air pollution guidelines, for example, are not based on the special needs of asthmatics. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines are not designed to protect people from interference with implanted medical electronic devices such as heart pacemakers. Instead, advice about exposure situations to be avoided should be sought from the manufacturers and from the clinician implanting the device.What are typical maximum exposure levels at home and in the environment?Some practical information will help you to relate to the international guideline values given above. In the following table you will find the most common sources of electromagnetic fields. All values are maximum levels of public exposure – your own exposure is likely to be much lower. For a closer look at field levels around individual electrical appliances, please see the section Typical exposure levels at home and in the environment.SourceTypical maximum public exposureElectric field (V/m)Magnetic flux density (µT)Natural fields20070 (Earth&#x27;s magnetic field)Mains power(in homes not close to power lines)1000.2Mains power(beneath large power lines)10 00020Electric trains and trams30050TV and computer screens(at operator position)100.7 Typical maximum public exposure (W/m2)TV and radio transmitters0.1Mobile phone base stations0.1Radars0.2Microwave ovens0.5Source: WHO Regional Office for EuropeHow are guidelines put into practice and who checks on them?The responsibility to investigate fields around power lines, mobile phone base stations or any other sources accessible to the general public lies with government agencies and local authorities. They must ensure that compliance with guidelines is maintained.With electronic devices, the manufacturer is responsible for complying with the standard limits. However, as we have seen above, the nature of most devices ensures that the emitted fields are well below the cut-off values. Furthermore, many consumer associations carry out tests on a regular basis. In case of any particular concern or worry, contact the manufacturer directly or enquire with your local public health authority.Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?It is perfectly safe to eat a pot of strawberry jam up to the expiration date – but if you consume the jam any later the manufacturer cannot guarantee good food quality. Nevertheless, even a few weeks or months after the expiration date, it will usually be safe to eat the jam. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines ensure that, within the given exposure limit, no known adverse health effects will occur. A large safety factor is applied to the level known to cause a health consequence. Therefore, even if you experienced field strengths several times higher than the given limit value, your exposure would still be within this safety margin.In everyday situations, most people do not experience electromagnetic fields that exceed the guideline limits. Typical exposures are far below these values. However, there are occasions where a person&#x27;s exposure may, for a short period, approach or even exceed the guidelines. According to ICNIRP, radiofrequency and microwave exposures should be averaged over time to address cumulative effects. The guidelines specify a time-averaging period of six minutes and short-term exposures above the limits are acceptable.In contrast, exposure to low frequency electric and magnetic fields is not time-averaged in the guidelines. To make things even more complicated, another factor called coupling comes into play. Coupling refers to the interaction between the electric and magnetic fields and the exposed body. This depends on the size and shape of the body, the type of tissue and the orientation of the body relative to the field. Guidelines must be conservative: ICNIRP always assumes maximum coupling of the field to the exposed individual. Thus the guideline limits provide maximum protection. For example, even though the magnetic field values for hairdryers and electric shavers appear to exceed the recommended values, extremely weak coupling between the field and the head prevents the induction of electrical currents that could exceed guideline limits.Key pointsICNIRP issues guidelines on the basis of the current scientific knowledge. Most countries draw on these international guidelines for their own national standards.Standards for low frequency electromagnetic fields ensure that induced electric currents are below the normal level of background currents within the body. Standards for radiofrequency and microwaves prevent health effects caused by localized or whole body heating.Guidelines do not protect against potential interference with electromedical devices.Maximum exposure levels in everyday life are typically far below guideline limits.Due to a large safety factor, exposure above the guideline limits is not necessarily harmful to health. Furthermore time-averaging for high frequency fields and the assumption of maximum coupling for low frequency fields introduce an additional safety margin.

With more and more research data available, it has become increasingly unlikely that exposure to electromagnetic fields constitutes a serious health hazard, nevertheless, some uncertainty remains. The original scientific discussion about the interpretation of controversial results has shifted to become a societal as well as political issue.The public debate over electromagnetic fields focuses on the potential detriments of electromagnetic fields but often ignores the benefits associated with electromagnetic field technology. Without electricity, society would come to a standstill. Similarly, broadcasting and telecommunications have become a simple fact of modern life. An analysis of the balance between cost and potential hazards is essential.Protection of public healthInternational guidelines and national safety standards for electromagnetic fields are developed on the basis of the current scientific knowledge to ensure that the fields humans encounter are not harmful to health. To compensate uncertainties in knowledge (due, for example, to experimental errors, extrapolation from animals to humans, or statistical uncertainty), large safety factors are incorporated into the exposure limits. The guidelines are regularly reviewed and updated if necessary. It has been suggested that taking additional precautions to cope with remaining uncertainties may be a useful policy to adopt while science improves knowledge on health consequences. However, the type and extent of the cautionary policy chosen critically depends on the strength of evidence for a health risk and the scale and nature of the potential consequences. The cautionary response should be proportional to the potential risk. For more information, see the WHO Backgrounder on Cautionary Policies.Several policies promoting caution have been developed to address concerns about public, occupational and environmental health and safety issues connected with chemical and physical agents.What should be done while research continues?One of the objectives of the International EMF Project is to help national authorities weigh the benefits of using electromagnetic field technologies against the possibility that a health risk might be discovered. Furthermore, the WHO will issue recommendations on protective measures, if they may be needed. It will take some years for the required research to be completed, evaluated and published. In the meantime, the World Health Organization has issued a series of recommendations:Strict adherence to existing national or international safety standards: such standards, based on current knowledge, are developed to protect everyone in the population with a large safety factor.Simple protective measures: barriers around strong electromagnetic field sources help preclude unauthorized access to areas where exposure limits may be exceeded.Consultation with local authorities and the public in siting new power lines or mobile phone base stations: siting decisions are often required to take into account aesthetics and public sensitivities. Open communication during the planning stages can help create public understanding and greater acceptance of a new facility.Communication: an effective system of health information and communication among scientists, governments, industry and the public can help raise general awareness of programmes dealing with exposure to electromagnetic fields and reduce any mistrust and fears.For further information, see the WHO Fact Sheets on Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Category: Biology      Published: August 18, 2022  The electromagnetic waves from all cell phone systems, including 5G systems, cause zero harm to humans. All cell phones and cell phone towers use radio waves to communicate. Radio waves have been in use for wireless communications for over a hundred years with no credible evidence of adverse health effects. The radio waves from cell phones do not mutate DNA, do not damage cells, and do not interfere with biological functions - not even a little bit! Furthermore, all objects naturally emit radio waves as part of their regular thermal emission. The radio waves emitted by a cell phone are physically no different from the radio waves continuously emitted by rocks, trees, desks, and all other physical objects. We are continuously immersed in radio waves emitted by rocks, trees, dirt, buildings, pencils, watermelons, physics professors, etc. Furthermore, the world has been immersed in these radio waves since the dawn of time, long before radio antennas came along. Radio waves are also what are used by AM/FM music radio stations. Note that I already effectively answered this question ten years ago. You can read my previous answer here. This article is actually nearly identical to that article that I wrote ten years ago. I am writing this article, despite being redundant, because of several requests from my readers to address 5G technology specifically. 5G cell phone communication networks may have more sophisticated engineering protocols than previous generations of cell phone communication networks, but they still use just plain old radio waves. "5G" stands for fifth generation. 5G radio waves are physically identical to 4G radio waves in terms of their overall physical characteristics. They are different in that 5G uses more clever ways to encode and process the information carried by the radio waves. The engineering is different but the physics is not. There are two ways that electromagnetic radiation in general can damage biological tissues, cells, and functioning: through ionization events and through bulk heating. An ionization event is when a bit of electromagnetic radiation knocks a single electron off of an atom or molecule. This can cause the chemical bond between two atoms to break, or can cause an atom to become a reactive ion which can then go on to break chemical bonds. If this happens too much, it can lead to mutations, cancer, radiation sickness, and/or tissue damage. However, only ionizing radiation has enough energy per photon to create an ionization event. The only forms of electromagnetic radiation that are ionizing are high-frequency ultraviolet rays, x-rays, and gamma rays. Radio waves have far too little energy per photon to ionize atoms. We are not just talking about a low amount of ionization from radio waves. Radio waves cause exactly zero individual atomic or molecular ionization events. They simply have far too little energy per photon to ionize atoms. In contrast, x-rays, some ultraviolet rays, and gamma rays do have enough energy per photon to cause individual ionization events. That is why there must be radiation-safety protocols, radiation shields, and radiation-safety-trained professionals in order for an x-ray machine to be used at a dentist's office, while none of this is needed at all to sit on a bench or walk by a rock or stand on the sidewalk, even those these things are continuously naturally emitting radio waves. The non-ionizing nature of radio waves is why you can listen to your favorite FM music radio station in your car and need zero radiation-safety equipment, zero radiation-safety protocols, and zero radiation-safety-trained professionals. Radio waves have far less energy per photon than visible light. If radio waves caused cancer then the regular visible light coming from a candle would cause thousands of times more cancer. But they don't. They do not have enough energy per photon to be ionizing. Note that all of this is very basic, very well-established, mainstream physics that has been known and verified countless times throughout many decades. I am not just guessing about this or sharing an opinion. The other way that electromagnetic radiation can affect biological tissue, cells, and functioning is through bulk heating. Bulk heating does not require a high energy per photon. It just requires a high total intensity of the electromagnetic wave. For this reason, all forms of electromagnetic radiation can cause bulk heating, including radio waves. This is why the microwave radiation in a microwave oven can heat up food while still having zero ability to cause individual ionization or cancer. Bulk heating from non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation is also what causes you to feel warm when you are standing near a campfire. The campfire emits radio waves and infrared waves with high enough intensity to warm you. If cell phone signals were powerful enough to heat you significantly, it would be no different from being warmed by a campfire. Bulk heating can indeed damage biological tissue by burning it. However, radio waves must have a very high total intensity to cause burns and thereby damage tissue. The radio waves used by cell phones, AM/FM radio channels, WIFI, and all other forms of radio communications are far too low in intensity to cause burns. Furthermore, radio waves that do indeed have high enough total intensity to cause physical burns through bulk heating are hard to generate and rare. For this reason, almost all types of burns that the typical person encounters; such as sunburns, burns from fires, burns from toasters, burns from irons, burns from electrical shocks, burns from acids, burns from heaters, burns from over-heated appliances, and so forth; are not caused by radio waves. The amount of radio waves emitted into the air by 5G telecommunications equipment is a drop in the bucket compared to the radio waves already present in the air from other sources. Furthermore, unlike the early stages of cancer and radiation poisoning, a physical burn from electromagnetic-wave bulk heating causes immediate pain, instantly triggering the person to back off from the source. If the radio waves from a 5G cell phone were powerful enough to cause burns (which they are not), it would feel just like getting burned from touching a hot iron. You would immediately pull your hand away before too much damage was done. Non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation can only heat and burn tissue in a non-specific, bulk-material manner; and cannot make individual changes at the cell level or molecular level. Note that the atoms and molecules that make up cells, cell parts, fluids, and other biological matter do indeed interact through the electromagnetic interaction. In fact, all chemical bonds and chemical reactions are ultimately caused by electromagnetic field effects. However, the atoms and molecules of biological matter interact through static atomic-scale electric fields, which are completely different from radio waves. Surprisingly, some people feel passionately that 5G signals are harmful to humans, despite there being zero credible evidence and zero physical plausibility. Some people believe that the secret purpose of installing 5G technology is to harm humans. The problem with this type of conspiracy theory (i.e., the widespread poisoning of public spaces by conspiring organizations) is that political and technology leaders are also human and also use public spaces. If the people responsible for implementing 5G technology were really causing harmful electromagnetic radiation to be broadcast into public spaces, they would also be harming themselves, their children and their loved ones. While there may indeed be a handful of evil or mentally ill people that are happy harming themselves and their loved ones while harming others, it is absurd to think that effectively all political and technology leaders, at all levels, in all countries, are happy harming themselves and their loved ones. In summary, 5G cell phone systems use radio waves to transmit information. These radio waves are non-ionizing and too weak to cause burns, and therefore cause zero harm to humans.

 Electromagnetic radiation can be classified into two types: ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation, based on the capability of a single photon with more than 10 eV energy to ionize atoms or break chemical bonds.[1] Extreme ultraviolet and higher frequencies, such as X-rays or gamma rays are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see radiation poisoning.
 The most common health hazard of radiation is sunburn, which causes between approximately 100,000 and 1 million new skin cancers annually in the United States.[2][3]
 In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).[4]
 Dielectric heating from electromagnetic fields can create a biological hazard. For example, touching or standing around an antenna while a high-power transmitter is in operation can cause burns (the mechanism is the same as that used in a microwave oven).[5]
 The heating effect varies with the power and the frequency of the electromagnetic energy, as well as the inverse square of distance to the source. The eyes and testes are particularly susceptible to radio frequency heating due to the paucity of blood flow in these areas that could otherwise dissipate the heat buildup.[6]
 Radio frequency (RF) energy at power density levels of 1–10 mW/cm2 or higher can cause measurable heating of tissues. Typical RF energy levels encountered by the general public are well below the level needed to cause significant heating, but certain workplace environments near high power RF sources may exceed safe exposure limits.[6] A measure of the heating effect is the specific absorption rate or SAR, which has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The IEEE[7] and many national governments have established safety limits for exposure to various frequencies of electromagnetic energy based on SAR, mainly based on ICNIRP Guidelines,[8] which guard against thermal damage.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) began a research effort in 1996 to study the health effects from the ever-increasing exposure of people to a diverse range of EMR sources. In 2011, the WHO/International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer, associated with wireless phone use.
 Epidemiological studies look for statistical correlations between EM exposure in the field and specific health effects. As of 2019, much of the current work is focused on the study of EM fields in relation to cancer.[9] There are publications which support the existence of complex biological and neurological effects of weaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields (see Bioelectromagnetics), including weak ELF electromagnetic fields[10][11] and modulated RF and microwave fields.[12][13]
 While the most acute exposures to harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation are immediately realized as burns, the health effects due to chronic or occupational exposure may not manifest effects for months or years.[14][15][3][16]
 Extremely low frequency EM waves can span from 0 Hz to 3 kHz, though definitions vary across disciplines. The maximum recommended exposure for the general public is 5 kV/m.[17]
 ELF waves around 50 Hz to 60 Hz are emitted by power generators, transmission lines and distribution lines, power cables, and electric appliances. Typical household exposure to ELF waves ranges in intensity from 5 V/m for a light bulb to 180 V/m for a stereo, measured at 30 centimetres (12 in) and using 240V power.[17] (120V power systems would be unable to reach this intensity unless an appliance has an internal voltage transformer.) Overhead power lines range from 1kV for local distribution to 1,150 kV for ultra high voltage lines. These can produce electric fields up to 10kV/m on the ground directly underneath, but 50 m to 100 m away these levels return to approximately ambient.[17]  Metal equipment must be maintained at a safe distance from energized high-voltage lines.[18]
 Exposure to ELF waves can induce an electric current. Because the human body is conductive, electric currents and resulting voltages differences typically accumulate on the skin but do not reach interior tissues.[19] People can start to perceive high-voltage charges as tingling when hair or clothing in contact with the skin stands up or vibrates.[19] In scientific tests, only about 10% of people could detect a field intensity in the range of 2-5 kV/m.[19] Such voltage differences can also create electric sparks, similar to a discharge of static electricity when nearly touching a grounded object. When receiving such a shock at 5 kV/m, it was reported as painful by only 7% of test participants and by 50% of participants at 10 kV/m.[19]
 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) finds "inadequate evidence" for human carcinogenicity.[20]
 Shortwave (1.6 to 30 MHz) diathermy (where EM waves are used to produce heat) can be used as a therapeutic technique for its analgesic effect and deep muscle relaxation, but has largely been replaced by ultrasound. Temperatures in muscles can increase by 4–6 °C, and subcutaneous fat by 15 °C. The FCC has restricted the frequencies allowed for medical treatment, and most machines in the US use 27.12 MHz.[21] Shortwave diathermy can be applied in either continuous or pulsed mode. The latter came to prominence because the continuous mode produced too much heating too rapidly, making patients uncomfortable. The technique only heats tissues that are good electrical conductors, such as blood vessels and muscle. Adipose tissue (fat) receives little heating by induction fields because an electrical current is not actually going through the tissues.[22]
 Studies have been performed on the use of shortwave radiation for cancer therapy and promoting wound healing, with some success. However, at a sufficiently high energy level, shortwave energy can be harmful to human health, potentially causing damage to biological tissues, for example by overheating or inducing electrical currents.[23] The FCC limits for maximum permissible workplace exposure to shortwave radio frequency energy in the range of 3–30 MHz has a plane-wave equivalent power density of (900/f2) mW/cm2 where f is the frequency in MHz, and 100 mW/cm2 from 0.3 to 3.0 MHz. For uncontrolled exposure to the general public, the limit is 180/f2 between 1.34 and 30 MHz.[6]
 The designation of mobile phone signals as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the World Health Organization (WHO) (e.g. its IARC, see below) has often been misinterpreted as indicating that some measure of risk has been observed –  however the designation indicates only that the possibility could not be conclusively ruled out using the available data.[24]
 In 2011, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified mobile phone radiation as Group 2B "possibly carcinogenic" (rather than Group 2A "probably carcinogenic" nor the "is carcinogenic" Group 1). That means that there "could be some risk" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.[25] The WHO concluded in 2014 that "A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."[26][27]
 Since 1962, the microwave auditory effect or tinnitus has been shown from radio frequency exposure at levels below significant heating.[28] Studies during the 1960s in Europe and Russia claimed to show effects on humans, especially the nervous system, from low energy RF radiation; the studies were disputed at the time.[29][30]
 In 2019, reporters from the Chicago Tribune tested the level of radiation from smartphones and found that certain models emitted more than reported by the manufacturers and in some cases more than the U.S. Federal Communications Commission exposure limit. It is unclear if this resulted in any harm to consumers. Some problems apparently involved the phone's ability to detect proximity to a human body and lower the radio power. In response, the FCC began testing some phones itself rather than relying solely on manufacturer certifications.[31]
 Microwave and other radio frequencies cause heating, and this can cause burns or eye damage if delivered in high intensity,[32] or hyperthermia as with any powerful heat source. Microwave ovens use this form of radiation, and have shielding to prevent it from leaking out and unintentionally heating nearby objects or people.
 In 2009, the US TSA introduced full-body scanners as a primary screening modality in airport security, first as backscatter X-ray scanners, which use ionizing radiation and which the European Union banned in 2011 due to health and safety concerns. These were followed by non-ionizing millimeter wave scanners.[33] Likewise WiGig for personal area networks have opened the 60 GHz and above microwave band to SAR exposure regulations. Previously, microwave applications in these bands were for point-to-point satellite communication with minimal human exposure.[34][relevant?]
 Infrared wavelengths longer than 750 nm can produce changes in the lens of the eye. Glassblower's cataract is an example of a heat injury that damages the anterior lens capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for prolonged periods over many years.[14]
 Exposing skin to infrared radiation near visible light (IR-A) leads to increased production of free radicals.[35] Short-term exposure can be beneficial (activating protective responses), while prolonged exposure can lead to photoaging.[36]
 Another important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of arc welding, infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does. This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.[citation needed]
 Photic retinopathy is damage to the macular area of the eye's retina that results from prolonged exposure to sunlight, particularly with dilated pupils. This can happen, for example, while observing a solar eclipse without suitable eye protection. The Sun's radiation creates a photochemical reaction that can result in visual dazzling and a scotoma. The initial lesions and edema will disappear after several weeks, but may leave behind a permanent reduction in visual acuity.[37]
 Moderate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the retina of the eye, or even the skin. To control the risk of injury, various specifications – for example ANSI Z136 in the US, EN 60825-1/A2 in Europe, and IEC 60825 internationally – define "classes" of lasers depending on their power and wavelength.[38][39] Regulations prescribe required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser safety goggles during operation (see laser safety).
 As with its infrared and ultraviolet radiation dangers, welding creates an intense brightness in the visible light spectrum, which may cause temporary flash blindness.  Some sources state that there is no minimum safe distance for exposure to these radiation emissions without adequate eye protection.[40]
 Sunlight includes sufficient ultraviolet power to cause sunburn within hours of exposure, and the burn severity increases with the duration of exposure. This effect is a response of the skin called erythema, which is caused by a sufficient strong dose of UV-B. The Sun's UV output is divided into UV-A and UV-B: solar UV-A flux is 100 times that of UV-B, but the erythema response is 1,000 times higher for UV-B.[citation needed] This exposure can increase at higher altitudes and when reflected by snow, ice, or sand. The UV-B flux is 2–4 times greater during the middle 4–6 hours of the day, and is not significantly absorbed by cloud cover or up to a meter of water.[41]
 Ultraviolet light, specifically UV-B, has been shown to cause cataracts and there is some evidence that sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life.[15] Most UV light from the sun is filtered out by the atmosphere and consequently airline pilots often have high rates of cataracts because of the increased levels of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.[42]  It is hypothesized that depletion of the ozone layer and a consequent increase in levels of UV light on the ground may increase future rates of cataracts.[43]  Note that the lens filters UV light, so if it is removed via surgery, one may be able to see UV light.[44][45][undue weight?  – discuss]
 Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[3] Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[3]  UV rays can also cause wrinkles, liver spots, moles, and freckles. In addition to sunlight, other sources include tanning beds, and bright desk lights.  Damage is cumulative over one's lifetime, so that permanent effects may not be evident for some time after exposure.[16]
 Ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 300 nm (actinic rays) can damage the corneal epithelium.  This is most commonly the result of exposure to the sun at high altitude, and in areas where shorter wavelengths are readily reflected from bright surfaces, such as snow, water, and sand.  UV generated by a welding arc can similarly cause damage to the cornea, known as "arc eye" or welding flash burn, a form of photokeratitis.[46]
 Fluorescent light bulbs and tubes internally produce ultraviolet light. Normally this is converted to visible light by the phosphor film inside a protective coating. When the film is cracked by mishandling or faulty manufacturing then UV may escape at levels that could cause sunburn or even skin cancer.[47][48]
 In the United States, nonionizing radiation is regulated in the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.[49]

 Electromagnetic radiation can be classified into two types: ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation, based on the capability of a single photon with more than 10 eV energy to ionize atoms or break chemical bonds.[1] Extreme ultraviolet and higher frequencies, such as X-rays or gamma rays are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see radiation poisoning.
 The most common health hazard of radiation is sunburn, which causes between approximately 100,000 and 1 million new skin cancers annually in the United States.[2][3]
 In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).[4]
 Dielectric heating from electromagnetic fields can create a biological hazard. For example, touching or standing around an antenna while a high-power transmitter is in operation can cause burns (the mechanism is the same as that used in a microwave oven).[5]
 The heating effect varies with the power and the frequency of the electromagnetic energy, as well as the inverse square of distance to the source. The eyes and testes are particularly susceptible to radio frequency heating due to the paucity of blood flow in these areas that could otherwise dissipate the heat buildup.[6]
 Radio frequency (RF) energy at power density levels of 1–10 mW/cm2 or higher can cause measurable heating of tissues. Typical RF energy levels encountered by the general public are well below the level needed to cause significant heating, but certain workplace environments near high power RF sources may exceed safe exposure limits.[6] A measure of the heating effect is the specific absorption rate or SAR, which has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The IEEE[7] and many national governments have established safety limits for exposure to various frequencies of electromagnetic energy based on SAR, mainly based on ICNIRP Guidelines,[8] which guard against thermal damage.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) began a research effort in 1996 to study the health effects from the ever-increasing exposure of people to a diverse range of EMR sources. In 2011, the WHO/International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer, associated with wireless phone use.
 Epidemiological studies look for statistical correlations between EM exposure in the field and specific health effects. As of 2019, much of the current work is focused on the study of EM fields in relation to cancer.[9] There are publications which support the existence of complex biological and neurological effects of weaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields (see Bioelectromagnetics), including weak ELF electromagnetic fields[10][11] and modulated RF and microwave fields.[12][13]
 While the most acute exposures to harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation are immediately realized as burns, the health effects due to chronic or occupational exposure may not manifest effects for months or years.[14][15][3][16]
 Extremely low frequency EM waves can span from 0 Hz to 3 kHz, though definitions vary across disciplines. The maximum recommended exposure for the general public is 5 kV/m.[17]
 ELF waves around 50 Hz to 60 Hz are emitted by power generators, transmission lines and distribution lines, power cables, and electric appliances. Typical household exposure to ELF waves ranges in intensity from 5 V/m for a light bulb to 180 V/m for a stereo, measured at 30 centimetres (12 in) and using 240V power.[17] (120V power systems would be unable to reach this intensity unless an appliance has an internal voltage transformer.) Overhead power lines range from 1kV for local distribution to 1,150 kV for ultra high voltage lines. These can produce electric fields up to 10kV/m on the ground directly underneath, but 50 m to 100 m away these levels return to approximately ambient.[17]  Metal equipment must be maintained at a safe distance from energized high-voltage lines.[18]
 Exposure to ELF waves can induce an electric current. Because the human body is conductive, electric currents and resulting voltages differences typically accumulate on the skin but do not reach interior tissues.[19] People can start to perceive high-voltage charges as tingling when hair or clothing in contact with the skin stands up or vibrates.[19] In scientific tests, only about 10% of people could detect a field intensity in the range of 2-5 kV/m.[19] Such voltage differences can also create electric sparks, similar to a discharge of static electricity when nearly touching a grounded object. When receiving such a shock at 5 kV/m, it was reported as painful by only 7% of test participants and by 50% of participants at 10 kV/m.[19]
 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) finds &quot;inadequate evidence&quot; for human carcinogenicity.[20]
 Shortwave (1.6 to 30 MHz) diathermy (where EM waves are used to produce heat) can be used as a therapeutic technique for its analgesic effect and deep muscle relaxation, but has largely been replaced by ultrasound. Temperatures in muscles can increase by 4–6 °C, and subcutaneous fat by 15 °C. The FCC has restricted the frequencies allowed for medical treatment, and most machines in the US use 27.12 MHz.[21] Shortwave diathermy can be applied in either continuous or pulsed mode. The latter came to prominence because the continuous mode produced too much heating too rapidly, making patients uncomfortable. The technique only heats tissues that are good electrical conductors, such as blood vessels and muscle. Adipose tissue (fat) receives little heating by induction fields because an electrical current is not actually going through the tissues.[22]
 Studies have been performed on the use of shortwave radiation for cancer therapy and promoting wound healing, with some success. However, at a sufficiently high energy level, shortwave energy can be harmful to human health, potentially causing damage to biological tissues, for example by overheating or inducing electrical currents.[23] The FCC limits for maximum permissible workplace exposure to shortwave radio frequency energy in the range of 3–30 MHz has a plane-wave equivalent power density of (900/f2) mW/cm2 where f is the frequency in MHz, and 100 mW/cm2 from 0.3 to 3.0 MHz. For uncontrolled exposure to the general public, the limit is 180/f2 between 1.34 and 30 MHz.[6]
 The designation of mobile phone signals as &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot; by the World Health Organization (WHO) (e.g. its IARC, see below) has often been misinterpreted as indicating that some measure of risk has been observed –  however the designation indicates only that the possibility could not be conclusively ruled out using the available data.[24]
 In 2011, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified mobile phone radiation as Group 2B &quot;possibly carcinogenic&quot; (rather than Group 2A &quot;probably carcinogenic&quot; nor the &quot;is carcinogenic&quot; Group 1). That means that there &quot;could be some risk&quot; of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.[25] The WHO concluded in 2014 that &quot;A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.&quot;[26][27]
 Since 1962, the microwave auditory effect or tinnitus has been shown from radio frequency exposure at levels below significant heating.[28] Studies during the 1960s in Europe and Russia claimed to show effects on humans, especially the nervous system, from low energy RF radiation; the studies were disputed at the time.[29][30]
 In 2019, reporters from the Chicago Tribune tested the level of radiation from smartphones and found that certain models emitted more than reported by the manufacturers and in some cases more than the U.S. Federal Communications Commission exposure limit. It is unclear if this resulted in any harm to consumers. Some problems apparently involved the phone&#x27;s ability to detect proximity to a human body and lower the radio power. In response, the FCC began testing some phones itself rather than relying solely on manufacturer certifications.[31]
 Microwave and other radio frequencies cause heating, and this can cause burns or eye damage if delivered in high intensity,[32] or hyperthermia as with any powerful heat source. Microwave ovens use this form of radiation, and have shielding to prevent it from leaking out and unintentionally heating nearby objects or people.
 In 2009, the US TSA introduced full-body scanners as a primary screening modality in airport security, first as backscatter X-ray scanners, which use ionizing radiation and which the European Union banned in 2011 due to health and safety concerns. These were followed by non-ionizing millimeter wave scanners.[33] Likewise WiGig for personal area networks have opened the 60 GHz and above microwave band to SAR exposure regulations. Previously, microwave applications in these bands were for point-to-point satellite communication with minimal human exposure.[34][relevant?]
 Infrared wavelengths longer than 750 nm can produce changes in the lens of the eye. Glassblower&#x27;s cataract is an example of a heat injury that damages the anterior lens capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for prolonged periods over many years.[14]
 Exposing skin to infrared radiation near visible light (IR-A) leads to increased production of free radicals.[35] Short-term exposure can be beneficial (activating protective responses), while prolonged exposure can lead to photoaging.[36]
 Another important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of arc welding, infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does. This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.[citation needed]
 Photic retinopathy is damage to the macular area of the eye&#x27;s retina that results from prolonged exposure to sunlight, particularly with dilated pupils. This can happen, for example, while observing a solar eclipse without suitable eye protection. The Sun&#x27;s radiation creates a photochemical reaction that can result in visual dazzling and a scotoma. The initial lesions and edema will disappear after several weeks, but may leave behind a permanent reduction in visual acuity.[37]
 Moderate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the retina of the eye, or even the skin. To control the risk of injury, various specifications – for example ANSI Z136 in the US, EN 60825-1/A2 in Europe, and IEC 60825 internationally – define &quot;classes&quot; of lasers depending on their power and wavelength.[38][39] Regulations prescribe required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser safety goggles during operation (see laser safety).
 As with its infrared and ultraviolet radiation dangers, welding creates an intense brightness in the visible light spectrum, which may cause temporary flash blindness.  Some sources state that there is no minimum safe distance for exposure to these radiation emissions without adequate eye protection.[40]
 Sunlight includes sufficient ultraviolet power to cause sunburn within hours of exposure, and the burn severity increases with the duration of exposure. This effect is a response of the skin called erythema, which is caused by a sufficient strong dose of UV-B. The Sun&#x27;s UV output is divided into UV-A and UV-B: solar UV-A flux is 100 times that of UV-B, but the erythema response is 1,000 times higher for UV-B.[citation needed] This exposure can increase at higher altitudes and when reflected by snow, ice, or sand. The UV-B flux is 2–4 times greater during the middle 4–6 hours of the day, and is not significantly absorbed by cloud cover or up to a meter of water.[41]
 Ultraviolet light, specifically UV-B, has been shown to cause cataracts and there is some evidence that sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life.[15] Most UV light from the sun is filtered out by the atmosphere and consequently airline pilots often have high rates of cataracts because of the increased levels of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.[42]  It is hypothesized that depletion of the ozone layer and a consequent increase in levels of UV light on the ground may increase future rates of cataracts.[43]  Note that the lens filters UV light, so if it is removed via surgery, one may be able to see UV light.[44][45][undue weight?  – discuss]
 Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[3] Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[3]  UV rays can also cause wrinkles, liver spots, moles, and freckles. In addition to sunlight, other sources include tanning beds, and bright desk lights.  Damage is cumulative over one&#x27;s lifetime, so that permanent effects may not be evident for some time after exposure.[16]
 Ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 300 nm (actinic rays) can damage the corneal epithelium.  This is most commonly the result of exposure to the sun at high altitude, and in areas where shorter wavelengths are readily reflected from bright surfaces, such as snow, water, and sand.  UV generated by a welding arc can similarly cause damage to the cornea, known as &quot;arc eye&quot; or welding flash burn, a form of photokeratitis.[46]
 Fluorescent light bulbs and tubes internally produce ultraviolet light. Normally this is converted to visible light by the phosphor film inside a protective coating. When the film is cracked by mishandling or faulty manufacturing then UV may escape at levels that could cause sunburn or even skin cancer.[47][48]
 In the United States, nonionizing radiation is regulated in the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.[49]

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Noise is a significant source of hearing loss, but you can protect your hearing. An important first step is to understand how noise causes hearing loss. Hearing loss can result from a single loud sound (like firecrackers) near your ear. Or, more often, hearing loss can result over time from damage caused by repeated exposures to loud sounds. The louder the sound, the shorter the amount of time it takes for hearing loss to occur. The longer the exposure, the greater the risk for hearing loss (especially when hearing protection is not used or there is not enough time for the ears to rest between exposures). Here are some sources of loud noise that you may be exposed to. If you are repeatedly exposed to them over time, they can cause hearing loss. Sound is measured in decibels (dB). A whisper is about 30 dB, normal conversation is about 60 dB, and a motorcycle engine running is about 95 dB. Noise above 70 dB over a prolonged period of time may start to damage your hearing. Loud noise above 120 dB can cause immediate harm to your ears. The table below shows dB levels and how noise from everyday sources can affect your hearing.   Sounds at these dB levels typically don’t cause any hearing damage.
 The time estimates listed in the “Typical Response” column are based on the NIOSH exchange rate of 3 dB. For more information, visit NIOSH’s website. How loud something sounds to you is not the same as the actual intensity of that sound. Sound intensity is the amount of sound energy in a confined space. It is measured in decibels (dB). The decibel scale is logarithmic, which means that loudness is not directly proportional to sound intensity. Instead, the intensity of a sound grows very fast. This means that a sound at 20 dB is 10 times more intense than a sound at 10 dB. Also, the intensity of a sound at 100 dB is one billion times more powerful compared to a sound at 10 dB. Two sounds that have equal intensity are not necessarily equally loud. Loudness refers to how you perceive audible sounds. A sound that seems loud in a quiet room might not be noticeable when you are on a street corner with heavy traffic, even though the sound intensity is the same. In general, to measure loudness, a sound must be increased by 10 dB to be perceived as twice as loud. For example, ten violins would sound only twice as loud as one violin. The risk of damaging your hearing from noise increases with the sound intensity, not the loudness of the sound. If you need to raise your voice to be heard at an arm’s length, the noise level in the environment is likely above 85 dB in sound intensity and could damage your hearing over time.  Top of Page The effect of lower noise levels over long periods is the same as louder noise levels over a shorter period. You can use a sound level meter (SLM) to measure noise around you. Free SLMs developed as smartphone apps are available. Some of these apps can predict your maximum allowable daily noise dose, like the NIOSH SLM app developed for iOS devices to help promote better hearing health and prevention efforts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend maintaining environmental noises below 70 dBA over 24-hours (75 dBA over 8-hours) to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. The EPA also specified limits for speech interference and annoyance at 55 dBA for outdoors activities and 45 dBA for indoor activities.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: What are electric and magnetic fields? What are common sources of non-ionizing EMFs? Why are non-ionizing EMFs studied in relation to cancer? What have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in children? What have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in adults? What do expert organizations conclude about the cancer risk from EMFs? Where can people find additional information on EMFs?　 What are electric and magnetic fields? Electric and magnetic fields are invisible areas of energy (also called radiation) that are produced by electricity, which is the movement of electrons, or current, through a wire. An electric field is produced by voltage, which is the pressure used to push the electrons through the wire, much like water being pushed through a pipe. As the voltage increases, the electric field increases in strength. Electric fields are measured in volts per meter (V/m). A magnetic field results from the flow of current through wires or electrical devices and increases in strength as the current increases. The strength of a magnetic field decreases rapidly with increasing distance from its source. Magnetic fields are measured in microteslas (μT, or millionths of a tesla). Electric fields are produced whether or not a device is turned on, whereas magnetic fields are produced only when current is flowing, which usually requires a device to be turned on. Power lines produce magnetic fields continuously because current is always flowing through them. Electric fields are easily shielded or weakened by walls and other objects, whereas magnetic fields can pass through buildings, living things, and most other materials. Electric and magnetic fields together are referred to as electromagnetic fields, or EMFs. The electric and magnetic forces in EMFs are caused by electromagnetic radiation. There are two main categories of EMFs: The electromagnetic spectrum represents all of the possible frequencies of electromagnetic energy. It ranges from extremely long wavelengths (extremely low frequency exposures such as those from power lines) to extremely short wavelengths (x-rays and gamma rays) and includes both non-ionizing and ionizing radiation. What are common sources of non-ionizing EMFs? There are both natural and human-made sources of non-ionizing EMFs. The earth’s magnetic field, which causes the needle on a compass to point North, is one example of a naturally occurring EMF. Human-made EMFs fall into both the ELF and radiofrequency categories of non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These EMFs can come from a number of sources.  Extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs). Sources of ELF-EMFs include power lines, electrical wiring, and electrical appliances such as shavers, hair dryers, and electric blankets. Radiofrequency radiation. The most common sources of radiofrequency radiation are wireless telecommunication devices and equipment, including cell phones, smart meters, and portable wireless devices, such as tablets and laptop computers (1). In the United States, cell phones currently operate in a frequency range of about 1.8 to 2.2 GHz (2). (For more information about cell phones, see the NCI fact sheet Cell Phones and Cancer Risk.) Other common sources of radiofrequency radiation include: For household appliances and other devices used in the home that require electricity, magnetic field levels are highest near the source of the field and decrease rapidly the farther away the user is from the source. Magnetic fields drop precipitously at a distance of about 1 foot from most appliances. For computer screens, at a distance of 12–20 inches from the screen that most persons using computers sit, magnetic fields are similarly dramatically lower.

For example, wireless local networks are nearly always “on” and are increasingly commonplace in homes, schools, and many public places. No mechanism by which ELF-EMFs or radiofrequency radiation could cause cancer has been identified. Unlike high-energy (ionizing) radiation, EMFs in the non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum cannot damage DNA or cells directly. Some scientists have speculated that ELF-EMFs could cause cancer through other mechanisms, such as by reducing levels of the hormone melatonin. There is some evidence that melatonin may suppress the development of certain tumors. Studies of animals have not provided any indications that exposure to ELF-EMFs is associated with cancer (10–13). The few high-quality studies in animals have provided no evidence that Wi-Fi is harmful to health (8). Although there is no known mechanism by which non-ionizing EMFs could damage DNA and cause cancer, even a small increase in risk would be of clinical importance given how widespread exposure to these fields is. What have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in children? Numerous epidemiologic studies and comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature have evaluated possible associations between exposure to non-ionizing EMFs and risk of cancer in children (13–15). (Magnetic fields are the component of non-ionizing EMFs that are usually studied in relation to their possible health effects.) Most of the research has focused on leukemia and brain tumors, the two most common cancers in children. Studies have examined associations of these cancers with living near power lines, with magnetic fields in the home, and with exposure of parents to high levels of magnetic fields in the workplace. No consistent evidence for an association between any source of non-ionizing EMF and cancer has been found. Exposure from power lines. Although a study in 1979 pointed to a possible association between living near electric power lines and childhood leukemia (16), more recent studies have had mixed findings (17–25). Most of these studies did not find an association or found one only for those children who lived in homes with very high levels of magnetic fields, which are present in few residences. Several studies have analyzed the combined data from multiple studies of power line exposure and childhood leukemia: For the two pooled studies and the meta-analysis, the number of highly exposed children was too small to provide stable estimates of the dose–response relationship. This means that the findings could be interpreted to reflect linear increases in risk, a threshold effect at 0.3 or 0.4 μT, or no significant increase. The interpretation of the finding of increased childhood leukemia risk among children with the highest exposures (at least 0.3 μT) is unclear. Exposure from electrical appliances. Another way that children can be exposed to magnetic fields is from household electrical appliances. Although magnetic fields near many electrical appliances are higher than those near power lines, appliances contribute less to a person’s total exposure to magnetic fields because most appliances are used for only short periods of time. And moving even a short distance from most electrical appliances reduces exposure dramatically. Again, studies have not found consistent evidence for an association between the use of household electrical appliances and risk of childhood leukemia (29). Exposure to Wi-Fi. In view of the widespread use of Wi-Fi in schools, the UK Health Protection Agency (now part of Public Health England) has conducted the largest and most comprehensive measurement studies to assess exposures of children to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from wireless computer networks (30, 31). This agency concluded that radiofrequency exposures were well below recommended maximum levels and that there was “no reason why Wi-Fi should not continue to be used in schools and in other places” (32).  A review of the published literature concluded that the few high-quality studies to date provide no evidence of biological effects from Wi-Fi exposures (7). Exposure from cell phone base stations. Few studies have examined cancer risk in children living close to cell phone base stations or radio or television transmitters. Mobile phone base stations transmit and receive radiofrequency signals to and from mobile phones near the station. None of the studies that estimated exposures on an individual level found an increased risk of pediatric tumors (33–35).  Parental exposure and risk in offspring. Several studies have examined possible associations between maternal or paternal exposure to high levels of magnetic fields before conception and/or during pregnancy and the risk of cancer in their future children. The results to date have been inconsistent (36, 37). This question requires further evaluation. Exposure and cancer survival. A few studies have investigated whether magnetic field exposure is associated with prognosis or survival of children with leukemia. Several small retrospective studies of this question have yielded inconsistent results (38–40). An analysis that combined prospective data for more than 3,000 children with acute lymphoid leukemia from eight countries showed that ELF magnetic field exposure was not associated with their survival or risk of relapse (41). What have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in adults? Many studies have examined the association between non-ionizing EMF exposure and cancer in adults, of which few studies have reported evidence of increased risk (1). Residential exposures. The majority of epidemiologic studies have shown no relationship between breast cancer in women and exposure to extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs) in the home (42–45), although a few individual studies have suggested an association; only one reported results that were statistically significant (46). Workplace exposures to ELF radiation. Several studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s reported that people who worked in some electrical occupations that exposed them to ELF radiation (such as power station operators and telephone line workers) had higher-than-expected rates of some types of cancer, particularly leukemia, brain tumors, and male breast cancer (13). Most of the results were based on participants’ job titles and not on actual measurements of their exposures.  More recent studies, including some that considered exposure measurements as well as job titles, have generally not shown an increasing risk of leukemia, brain tumors, or female breast cancer with increasing exposure to magnetic fields at work (46–51). Workplace exposures to radiofrequency radiation. A limited number of studies have evaluated risks of cancer in workers exposed to radiofrequency radiation. A large study of U.S. Navy personnel found no excess of brain tumors among those with a high probability of exposure to radar (including electronics technicians, aviation technicians, and fire control technicians); however, nonlymphocytic leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia, was increased in electronics technicians in aviation squadrons, but not in Navy personnel in the other job categories (52). A case–control study among U.S. Air Force personnel found the suggestion of an increased risk of brain cancer among personnel who maintained or repaired radiofrequency or microwave-emitting equipment (53). A case–control study found the suggestion of an increased risk of death from brain cancer among men occupationally exposed to microwave and/or radiofrequency radiation, with all of the excess risk among workers in electrical and electronics jobs involving design, manufacture, repair, or installation of electrical or electronics equipment (54). There was no evidence that electrical utility workers who were exposed to pulsed electromagnetic fields produced by power lines were more likely to develop brain tumors or leukemia than the general population (55). Employees of a large manufacturer of wireless communication products were not more likely to die from brain tumors or cancers of the hematopoietic or lymphatic system than the general population (56). A large prospective study among police officers in Great Britain found no evidence for an association between radiofrequency EMF exposure from personal radio use and the risk of all cancers combined (57). A large multinational population-based case–control study found no clear evidence that occupational exposures to radiofrequency radiation are associated with increased risks of glioma or meningioma (58). What do expert organizations conclude about the cancer risk from EMFs? In 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a component of the World Health Organization, appointed an expert Working Group to review all available evidence on static and extremely low frequency electric and magnetic fields (13). The Working Group classified ELF-EMFs as “possibly carcinogenic to humans,” based on limited evidence from human studies in relation to childhood leukemia. Static electric and magnetic fields and extremely low frequency electric fields were determined “not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans” (13). In 2015, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks reviewed electromagnetic fields in general, as well as cell phones in particular. It found that, overall, epidemiologic studies of extremely low frequency fields show an increased risk of childhood leukemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 μT, although no mechanisms have been identified and there is no support from experimental studies that explains these findings. It also found that the epidemiologic studies on radiofrequency exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumors or other cancers of the head and neck region, although the possibility of an association with acoustic neuroma remains open (59).

Where can people find additional information on EMFs?　 What are electric and magnetic fields? Electric and magnetic fields are invisible areas of energy (also called radiation) that are produced by electricity, which is the movement of electrons, or current, through a wire. An electric field is produced by voltage, which is the pressure used to push the electrons through the wire, much like water being pushed through a pipe. As the voltage increases, the electric field increases in strength. Electric fields are measured in volts per meter (V/m). A magnetic field results from the flow of current through wires or electrical devices and increases in strength as the current increases. The strength of a magnetic field decreases rapidly with increasing distance from its source. Magnetic fields are measured in microteslas (μT, or millionths of a tesla). Electric fields are produced whether or not a device is turned on, whereas magnetic fields are produced only when current is flowing, which usually requires a device to be turned on. Power lines produce magnetic fields continuously because current is always flowing through them. Electric fields are easily shielded or weakened by walls and other objects, whereas magnetic fields can pass through buildings, living things, and most other materials. Electric and magnetic fields together are referred to as electromagnetic fields, or EMFs. The electric and magnetic forces in EMFs are caused by electromagnetic radiation. There are two main categories of EMFs: The electromagnetic spectrum represents all of the possible frequencies of electromagnetic energy. It ranges from extremely long wavelengths (extremely low frequency exposures such as those from power lines) to extremely short wavelengths (x-rays and gamma rays) and includes both non-ionizing and ionizing radiation. What are common sources of non-ionizing EMFs? There are both natural and human-made sources of non-ionizing EMFs. The earth’s magnetic field, which causes the needle on a compass to point North, is one example of a naturally occurring EMF. Human-made EMFs fall into both the ELF and radiofrequency categories of non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These EMFs can come from a number of sources.  Extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs). Sources of ELF-EMFs include power lines, electrical wiring, and electrical appliances such as shavers, hair dryers, and electric blankets. Radiofrequency radiation. The most common sources of radiofrequency radiation are wireless telecommunication devices and equipment, including cell phones, smart meters, and portable wireless devices, such as tablets and laptop computers (1). In the United States, cell phones currently operate in a frequency range of about 1.8 to 2.2 GHz (2). (For more information about cell phones, see the NCI fact sheet Cell Phones and Cancer Risk.) Other common sources of radiofrequency radiation include: For household appliances and other devices used in the home that require electricity, magnetic field levels are highest near the source of the field and decrease rapidly the farther away the user is from the source. Magnetic fields drop precipitously at a distance of about 1 foot from most appliances. For computer screens, at a distance of 12–20 inches from the screen that most persons using computers sit, magnetic fields are similarly dramatically lower.

Although there is no known mechanism by which non-ionizing EMFs could damage DNA and cause cancer, even a small increase in risk would be of clinical importance given how widespread exposure to these fields is. What have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in children? Numerous epidemiologic studies and comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature have evaluated possible associations between exposure to non-ionizing EMFs and risk of cancer in children (13–15). (Magnetic fields are the component of non-ionizing EMFs that are usually studied in relation to their possible health effects.) Most of the research has focused on leukemia and brain tumors, the two most common cancers in children. Studies have examined associations of these cancers with living near power lines, with magnetic fields in the home, and with exposure of parents to high levels of magnetic fields in the workplace. No consistent evidence for an association between any source of non-ionizing EMF and cancer has been found. Exposure from power lines. Although a study in 1979 pointed to a possible association between living near electric power lines and childhood leukemia (16), more recent studies have had mixed findings (17–25). Most of these studies did not find an association or found one only for those children who lived in homes with very high levels of magnetic fields, which are present in few residences. Several studies have analyzed the combined data from multiple studies of power line exposure and childhood leukemia: For the two pooled studies and the meta-analysis, the number of highly exposed children was too small to provide stable estimates of the dose–response relationship. This means that the findings could be interpreted to reflect linear increases in risk, a threshold effect at 0.3 or 0.4 μT, or no significant increase. The interpretation of the finding of increased childhood leukemia risk among children with the highest exposures (at least 0.3 μT) is unclear. Exposure from electrical appliances. Another way that children can be exposed to magnetic fields is from household electrical appliances. Although magnetic fields near many electrical appliances are higher than those near power lines, appliances contribute less to a person’s total exposure to magnetic fields because most appliances are used for only short periods of time. And moving even a short distance from most electrical appliances reduces exposure dramatically. Again, studies have not found consistent evidence for an association between the use of household electrical appliances and risk of childhood leukemia (29). Exposure to Wi-Fi. In view of the widespread use of Wi-Fi in schools, the UK Health Protection Agency (now part of Public Health England) has conducted the largest and most comprehensive measurement studies to assess exposures of children to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from wireless computer networks (30, 31). This agency concluded that radiofrequency exposures were well below recommended maximum levels and that there was “no reason why Wi-Fi should not continue to be used in schools and in other places” (32).  A review of the published literature concluded that the few high-quality studies to date provide no evidence of biological effects from Wi-Fi exposures (7). Exposure from cell phone base stations. Few studies have examined cancer risk in children living close to cell phone base stations or radio or television transmitters. Mobile phone base stations transmit and receive radiofrequency signals to and from mobile phones near the station. None of the studies that estimated exposures on an individual level found an increased risk of pediatric tumors (33–35).  Parental exposure and risk in offspring. Several studies have examined possible associations between maternal or paternal exposure to high levels of magnetic fields before conception and/or during pregnancy and the risk of cancer in their future children. The results to date have been inconsistent (36, 37). This question requires further evaluation. Exposure and cancer survival. A few studies have investigated whether magnetic field exposure is associated with prognosis or survival of children with leukemia. Several small retrospective studies of this question have yielded inconsistent results (38–40). An analysis that combined prospective data for more than 3,000 children with acute lymphoid leukemia from eight countries showed that ELF magnetic field exposure was not associated with their survival or risk of relapse (41). What have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in adults? Many studies have examined the association between non-ionizing EMF exposure and cancer in adults, of which few studies have reported evidence of increased risk (1). Residential exposures. The majority of epidemiologic studies have shown no relationship between breast cancer in women and exposure to extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs) in the home (42–45), although a few individual studies have suggested an association; only one reported results that were statistically significant (46). Workplace exposures to ELF radiation. Several studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s reported that people who worked in some electrical occupations that exposed them to ELF radiation (such as power station operators and telephone line workers) had higher-than-expected rates of some types of cancer, particularly leukemia, brain tumors, and male breast cancer (13). Most of the results were based on participants’ job titles and not on actual measurements of their exposures.  More recent studies, including some that considered exposure measurements as well as job titles, have generally not shown an increasing risk of leukemia, brain tumors, or female breast cancer with increasing exposure to magnetic fields at work (46–51). Workplace exposures to radiofrequency radiation. A limited number of studies have evaluated risks of cancer in workers exposed to radiofrequency radiation. A large study of U.S. Navy personnel found no excess of brain tumors among those with a high probability of exposure to radar (including electronics technicians, aviation technicians, and fire control technicians); however, nonlymphocytic leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia, was increased in electronics technicians in aviation squadrons, but not in Navy personnel in the other job categories (52). A case–control study among U.S. Air Force personnel found the suggestion of an increased risk of brain cancer among personnel who maintained or repaired radiofrequency or microwave-emitting equipment (53). A case–control study found the suggestion of an increased risk of death from brain cancer among men occupationally exposed to microwave and/or radiofrequency radiation, with all of the excess risk among workers in electrical and electronics jobs involving design, manufacture, repair, or installation of electrical or electronics equipment (54). There was no evidence that electrical utility workers who were exposed to pulsed electromagnetic fields produced by power lines were more likely to develop brain tumors or leukemia than the general population (55). Employees of a large manufacturer of wireless communication products were not more likely to die from brain tumors or cancers of the hematopoietic or lymphatic system than the general population (56). A large prospective study among police officers in Great Britain found no evidence for an association between radiofrequency EMF exposure from personal radio use and the risk of all cancers combined (57). A large multinational population-based case–control study found no clear evidence that occupational exposures to radiofrequency radiation are associated with increased risks of glioma or meningioma (58). What do expert organizations conclude about the cancer risk from EMFs? In 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a component of the World Health Organization, appointed an expert Working Group to review all available evidence on static and extremely low frequency electric and magnetic fields (13). The Working Group classified ELF-EMFs as “possibly carcinogenic to humans,” based on limited evidence from human studies in relation to childhood leukemia. Static electric and magnetic fields and extremely low frequency electric fields were determined “not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans” (13). In 2015, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks reviewed electromagnetic fields in general, as well as cell phones in particular. It found that, overall, epidemiologic studies of extremely low frequency fields show an increased risk of childhood leukemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 μT, although no mechanisms have been identified and there is no support from experimental studies that explains these findings. It also found that the epidemiologic studies on radiofrequency exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumors or other cancers of the head and neck region, although the possibility of an association with acoustic neuroma remains open (59). Where can people find additional information on EMFs?　 The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) website has information about EMFs and cancer. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration website has information about workplace exposures to ELF-EMF. The US Environmental Protection Agency website has information on power lines and other sources of EMF. The European Commission also has general information on EMF.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: We are exposed to electromagnetic fields and waves on a daily basis: from sunlight, during X-ray examinations, when standing near electrical cables or while using our mobile phones. What exactly are they? What are their potential health effects? Can they also have consequences on animal health? Can we limit our exposure and if so, how? This article provides some answers.   A radio or television antenna or a mobile phone in use generates electromagnetic fields that propagate through the environment in the form of waves. There are also electromagnetic fields of natural origin such as the Earth's magnetic field or fields generated by lightning. Other naturally occurring electromagnetic waves include ultraviolet radiation and visible light from the Sun. Waves carry energy and can be used to transmit data, which is why they are used in radio communications. Electromagnetic waves or fields are characterised by their frequency, i.e. the number of oscillations of the electromagnetic field in one second. This frequency is expressed in Hertz. The main electromagnetic fields created by human activities are: Lastly, electromagnetic fields are also widely used in industry and the medical sector: Exposure to high-intensity low-frequency electromagnetic fields, such as those emitted by certain industrial machines, for example, can stimulate the nervous tissue of the human body, as well as the retina. In the area of radiofrequencies, exposure to high levels of electromagnetic waves can cause heating of biological tissues (the skin, but also the body's internal tissues); this is known as the thermal effect. However, the exposure limits currently in force in France ensure that such levels of radio waves are never reached in public places or under the normal conditions of use of emitting devices. Some experimental studies have shown that biological effects can also occur from exposure to lower levels of electromagnetic fields than those causing nerve stimulation (low frequency) or a significant increase in tissue temperature (radiofrequency). These effects include temporary changes in the functioning of certain cells or organs. However, such biological changes are regularly observed as part of the body's normal functioning. In addition, exposure to the waves emitted by a mobile phone has been associated with a change in the electrical activity of the brain. However, these effects have not been shown to have any impact on health. Lastly, the simultaneous exposure of populations to numerous sources of electromagnetic fields has raised the question of the possible effects that could be associated with this multiple exposure. Given this complexity, only a multidisciplinary approach can meet the challenges to health risk assessment posed by technological innovations. The working groups set up by ANSES to assess these risks bring together biologists, epidemiologists, physicists, risk assessors and researchers specialising in the area of interactions between electromagnetic fields and the human body, who together contribute to meeting these challenges. ANSES assesses the possible health effects of electromagnetic fields in order to inform public decision-making. In particular, the Agency has issued opinions on the health effects of 5G deployment, high-voltage lines, body scanners and light-emitting diodes. Based on current knowledge, the Agency's work does not show any causal link between exposure to the waves emitted by mobile communication technologies and health effects. However, some publications have suggested a possible long-term increased risk of brain tumours for heavy mobile phone users, which is why the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as "possibly carcinogenic". ANSES's most recent expert appraisals had also highlighted, with limited levels of proof, various biological effects in humans and in animals, some of which had already been reported in a previous expert appraisal published in 2009, concerning sleep, male animal fertility and cognitive performance. Indeed, biological effects corresponding to generally reversible alterations in internal bodily function were observed, as in the case of exposure to various everyday stimuli . However, to date, no link between the biological effects described in cell, animal or human models and any resulting health effects has been demonstrated. Some of the energy carried by electromagnetic waves that interact with the human body is reflected back outwards, while the rest is absorbed. To quantify this effect, the reference measurement is the specific absorption rate (SAR), for all waves between 100 kHz and 6 GHz. The SAR is expressed in Watts per kilogram (W/kg). To limit exposure to these waves, users are advised to buy mobile phones with the lowest SAR values.  Populations are exposed to many sources of low-frequency electromagnetic fields, including power lines, transformers and modes of transport outdoors, or electrical appliances inside the home.  The home is the source of the highest levels of magnetic fields, produced by domestic appliances, but the associated exposure is usually very brief and localised. Outside the home, the highest electromagnetic field values are measured primarily under very-high-voltage power lines or next to transformers and electricity substations. Some industrial activities may also generate much higher exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields. ANSES has not found any causal link between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields in the everyday environment and health effects. However, there are still questions about the possible long-term effect of exposure to sources of these fields – such as very high-voltage power lines – on the occurrence of childhood leukaemia or the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, no biological mechanism to explain the epidemiological observations has yet been identified. For several decades, the scientific literature has been reporting cases of people claiming to suffer from various symptoms that they attribute to their exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by household appliances, electrical installations or mobile technologies. This is what is known as electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Current scientific knowledge shows no cause-and-effect relationship between the symptoms of people declaring themselves as electrohypersensitive (EHS) and their exposure to electromagnetic waves. However, in an expert appraisal on this specific topic, the Agency stressed that the pain and suffering (headaches, sleep, attention and memory disorders, social isolation, etc.) expressed by the people declaring themselves as EHS is a reality, requiring them to adapt their daily lives to cope with it. The Agency recommended pursuing research work, in particular by setting up studies whose experimental conditions take into account the circumstances of people declaring themselves as EHS. The Agency's expert appraisal published in 2015 on the consequences of exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields on farm animal health stressed that it is still difficult to give an opinion on this subject. In 2021, the Agency also issued an opinion on disorders on two cattle farms located near a wind farm, a facility connected to the electricity grid and a source of electromagnetic fields. It concluded that the problems encountered – reduced milk yield and quality, behavioural problems, increased mortality – were most likely unrelated to the presence of the wind turbines. In France, as in most European countries, regulatory limit values for exposure of the general population to electromagnetic fields have been set in accordance with the European Union's 1999 recommendations (Recommendation 1999/519/EC). These limit values are intended to protect people and the environment from the harmful effects of electromagnetic fields. Exposure of the public to radiofrequencies emitted by equipment used in telecommunications networks or by radio installations is thus specifically regulated (Decree No. 2002-775 of 3 May 2002). It is monitored by the French Frequency Agency (ANFR). The checks carried out each year show that environmental exposure to radio waves is well below the regulatory limits. Of the 4700 measurements carried out in 2020, almost 80% showed exposure of less than 1 volt per metre (V/m), whereas the regulatory limit values are between 28 and 87 V/m depending on the frequency. All these measures are made public. The ANFR also carries out numerous checks on the SAR of mobile phones and, if the limit values are exceeded, it proposes that the terminals in question be updated or even withdrawn from the market. Under the national programme for the surveillance and measurement of public exposure to electromagnetic waves, managed by the ANFR, any individual, along with the State, local authorities and approved associations, can request that exposure be measured free of charge to waves generated by a relay antenna or communicating object such as the Linky smart electricity meter. Measurements can be carried out both in residential premises and in places accessible to the public (parks, shops, stations, etc.). To enable the health risks of waves to be assessed, the results of these measurements are transmitted to ANSES under Article 42 of the Grenelle I Act of 3 August 20091. Regarding exposure to low frequencies, following the Grenelle 1 and 2 Acts, a system for monitoring and verifying electromagnetic fields emitted by public electricity transmission networks was set up. The data collected in this context are published on this site.   Limit exposure to waves emitted by mobile telephones (radiofrequencies): In the workplace, some jobs, particularly in connection with the use of certain industrial machines, may involve greater exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields. The Agency therefore stresses the need for better control of exposure in the workplace for certain professionals, particularly pregnant women. Stakeholders responsible for land use planning should stop any further increase in the number of vulnerable people exposed around high-voltage lines by avoiding:   1  ANSES, represented by its Director General, is responsible for the processing of personal data intended for characterising population exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.

Lastly, the simultaneous exposure of populations to numerous sources of electromagnetic fields has raised the question of the possible effects that could be associated with this multiple exposure. Given this complexity, only a multidisciplinary approach can meet the challenges to health risk assessment posed by technological innovations. The working groups set up by ANSES to assess these risks bring together biologists, epidemiologists, physicists, risk assessors and researchers specialising in the area of interactions between electromagnetic fields and the human body, who together contribute to meeting these challenges. ANSES assesses the possible health effects of electromagnetic fields in order to inform public decision-making. In particular, the Agency has issued opinions on the health effects of 5G deployment, high-voltage lines, body scanners and light-emitting diodes. Based on current knowledge, the Agency&#x27;s work does not show any causal link between exposure to the waves emitted by mobile communication technologies and health effects. However, some publications have suggested a possible long-term increased risk of brain tumours for heavy mobile phone users, which is why the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as &quot;possibly carcinogenic&quot;. ANSES&#x27;s most recent expert appraisals had also highlighted, with limited levels of proof, various biological effects in humans and in animals, some of which had already been reported in a previous expert appraisal published in 2009, concerning sleep, male animal fertility and cognitive performance. Indeed, biological effects corresponding to generally reversible alterations in internal bodily function were observed, as in the case of exposure to various everyday stimuli . However, to date, no link between the biological effects described in cell, animal or human models and any resulting health effects has been demonstrated. Some of the energy carried by electromagnetic waves that interact with the human body is reflected back outwards, while the rest is absorbed. To quantify this effect, the reference measurement is the specific absorption rate (SAR), for all waves between 100 kHz and 6 GHz. The SAR is expressed in Watts per kilogram (W/kg). To limit exposure to these waves, users are advised to buy mobile phones with the lowest SAR values.  Populations are exposed to many sources of low-frequency electromagnetic fields, including power lines, transformers and modes of transport outdoors, or electrical appliances inside the home.  The home is the source of the highest levels of magnetic fields, produced by domestic appliances, but the associated exposure is usually very brief and localised. Outside the home, the highest electromagnetic field values are measured primarily under very-high-voltage power lines or next to transformers and electricity substations. Some industrial activities may also generate much higher exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields. ANSES has not found any causal link between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields in the everyday environment and health effects. However, there are still questions about the possible long-term effect of exposure to sources of these fields – such as very high-voltage power lines – on the occurrence of childhood leukaemia or the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, no biological mechanism to explain the epidemiological observations has yet been identified. For several decades, the scientific literature has been reporting cases of people claiming to suffer from various symptoms that they attribute to their exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by household appliances, electrical installations or mobile technologies. This is what is known as electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Current scientific knowledge shows no cause-and-effect relationship between the symptoms of people declaring themselves as electrohypersensitive (EHS) and their exposure to electromagnetic waves. However, in an expert appraisal on this specific topic, the Agency stressed that the pain and suffering (headaches, sleep, attention and memory disorders, social isolation, etc.) expressed by the people declaring themselves as EHS is a reality, requiring them to adapt their daily lives to cope with it. The Agency recommended pursuing research work, in particular by setting up studies whose experimental conditions take into account the circumstances of people declaring themselves as EHS. The Agency&#x27;s expert appraisal published in 2015 on the consequences of exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields on farm animal health stressed that it is still difficult to give an opinion on this subject. In 2021, the Agency also issued an opinion on disorders on two cattle farms located near a wind farm, a facility connected to the electricity grid and a source of electromagnetic fields. It concluded that the problems encountered – reduced milk yield and quality, behavioural problems, increased mortality – were most likely unrelated to the presence of the wind turbines. In France, as in most European countries, regulatory limit values for exposure of the general population to electromagnetic fields have been set in accordance with the European Union&#x27;s 1999 recommendations (Recommendation 1999/519/EC). These limit values are intended to protect people and the environment from the harmful effects of electromagnetic fields. Exposure of the public to radiofrequencies emitted by equipment used in telecommunications networks or by radio installations is thus specifically regulated (Decree No. 2002-775 of 3 May 2002). It is monitored by the French Frequency Agency (ANFR). The checks carried out each year show that environmental exposure to radio waves is well below the regulatory limits. Of the 4700 measurements carried out in 2020, almost 80% showed exposure of less than 1 volt per metre (V/m), whereas the regulatory limit values are between 28 and 87 V/m depending on the frequency. All these measures are made public. The ANFR also carries out numerous checks on the SAR of mobile phones and, if the limit values are exceeded, it proposes that the terminals in question be updated or even withdrawn from the market. Under the national programme for the surveillance and measurement of public exposure to electromagnetic waves, managed by the ANFR, any individual, along with the State, local authorities and approved associations, can request that exposure be measured free of charge to waves generated by a relay antenna or communicating object such as the Linky smart electricity meter. Measurements can be carried out both in residential premises and in places accessible to the public (parks, shops, stations, etc.). To enable the health risks of waves to be assessed, the results of these measurements are transmitted to ANSES under Article 42 of the Grenelle I Act of 3 August 20091. Regarding exposure to low frequencies, following the Grenelle 1 and 2 Acts, a system for monitoring and verifying electromagnetic fields emitted by public electricity transmission networks was set up. The data collected in this context are published on this site.   Limit exposure to waves emitted by mobile telephones (radiofrequencies): In the workplace, some jobs, particularly in connection with the use of certain industrial machines, may involve greater exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields. The Agency therefore stresses the need for better control of exposure in the workplace for certain professionals, particularly pregnant women. Stakeholders responsible for land use planning should stop any further increase in the number of vulnerable people exposed around high-voltage lines by avoiding:   1  ANSES, represented by its Director General, is responsible for the processing of personal data intended for characterising population exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Advertisement In "The Calculus Affair," one of the volumes in Hergé's classic Tintin comic book series, the brilliant Professor Calculus invents a sonic device so destructive he's kidnaped by a hostile government that intends to coerce him into building acoustic weaponry. The malevolent military strategists behind the kidnaping are plotting to destroy whole cities with intense blasts of sound. Luckily, of course, Calculus's good friends, the adventurous reporter Tintin and his sidekick Captain Haddock, rescue the professor and foil the evil plot in the nick of time. But is there any science behind this storyline? Can sound really kill? And if so, how? Sound is made by waves of pressure moving through a medium, like air. Those waves can also move through solids and liquids, which means they can move through bodies, too. Theoretically, if you can build up enough pressure, you can do some damage. Advertisement The two key measurements when it comes to sound are decibels (dB) and hertz (Hz). A decibel is a unit of sound intensity, while hertz refers to the frequency at which the sound waves are moving. Normal conversation occurs between 50 and 65 dB. A lawnmower runs around 85 to 90 dB, while a jackhammer ratchets the noise up to 110 dB, and a nearby jet engine gets you up into the 140 dB range [source: NIH]. Humans can only hear sound waves between 20 and 20,000 Hz, but sound waves can still affect us below that threshold. If you sit in front of a subwoofer with the frequency at 19 Hz, even with the volume turned up to 100 dB, you won't hear anything — but you'll feel the vibrations. In fact, at 19 Hz, your eyes start to go all wonky because that happens to be the resonant frequency of the human eyeball. If you're exposed to 177 dB sound waves at 0.5 to 8 Hz, it can start messing with your lungs, making your breathing erratic and literally shaking your bones around. Short-term exposure can damage your joints, but the effects of chronic exposure can include nausea and visual impairment [source: Horowitz]. The European Space Agency (ESA) claims that if you somehow got accidentally locked inside their Large European Acoustic Facility (LEAF) for testing the acoustic resiliency of their satellites, you wouldn't survive the sonic onslaught. A key factor here is that you'd be in an enclosed space. Outside, sound waves disperse and dissipate too quickly to reach lethal levels. That hasn't stopped researchers from investigating the use of sound as a weapon. It's been calculated, for instance, that it would require 240 dB to make a human head explode. That's a whole lot of decibels. It would be next to impossible to generate this level of noise. Even when the ESA's LEAF cranks its sound up to peak intensity, it's only putting out around 154 dB [source: ESA]. But for non-lethal purposes, sound weaponry can really come in handy. Say, for instance, you want to dissuade a boatload of Somalian pirates from joining your cruise. Try turning on your trusty $30,000 long-range acoustic device (LRAD) and hammering them with a beam of 150 dB of bone-jarring noise, which can cause permanent hearing loss for its targets even at distances of 1,000 feet (300 meters) [source: Blenford].
