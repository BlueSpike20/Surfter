Surfter:
Use AI to analyze user generated query results for accuracy, bias, motivation and logic, then produce a webpage with delightful and easily consumable Hyperanalysis and infographics.

Run Surfter.py to spit out an html doc created by surfing and sifting the web using the query, QueryString.



TODO: Create a tierd user layer with modest ad content for free members, with top teir able to send custom queries up the stack. --- In Progress

TODO: Once we have the column of AI responses, do another AI summary of the summeries for the infographic and hyperanalysis. 

TODO: Break the generate_html function out of Surfter.py and make it its own file. 

TODO: Create logic that removes gpt request for articles that fail souptext. Either keep image or step over before rendering.

TODO: If HTML filename exists in the archive, need to stomp. 

TODO: FIX:
