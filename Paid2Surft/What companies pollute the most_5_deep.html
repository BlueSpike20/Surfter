This article discusses the role of companies and investors in tackling climate change. It reveals that 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global GHG emissions since 1988, and calls on investors to commit to decarbonization. It also highlights the positive steps taken by corporations to transition to renewable energy sources.

                    Empty search Just 100 of all the hundreds of thousands of companies in the world have been responsible for 71% of the global GHG emissions that cause global warming since 1998, according to The Carbon Majors Database, a report recently published by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), throwing light on the role companies and investors play in tackling climate change. CDP is a non-profit organization dedicated to global disclosure of information to aid governments, companies and investors with managing their environmental impact. According to the study, since 1988, the year in which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was formed, over half of the world’s industrial emissions can be traced back to just 25 state companies and entities. The CDP report also reveals that 32% of emissions come from public investor-owned companies, making their investors a key agent in the transition to a sustainable economy. These investors could make their economic support conditional on the companies committing to decarbonization of the energy sector. As many experts point out, investors who keep their stakes in companies dedicated to fossil fuels will find that this strategy will become riskier with time. The energy sector is changing fast and the transition could leave those who continue to invest in fossil fuels stranded.   If companies continue to extract fossil fuels at the rate they have been doing over the past 28 years, it is estimated that the global average temperature will rise by up to 4°C, which will result in the possible extinction of a multitude of species and seriously threaten world food production. According to the CDP, between 1988 and 2015, 100 companies were responsible for 71% of global GHG emissions. The Carbon Majors Database report names the following 10 companies as those which belch most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere:  On the upside, more and more large corporations are supporting the transition to a carbon-free economy and have committed to obtaining energy of 100% renewable origin. This change is being led by a group of companies that includes Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea.   Sources: The Carbon Majors Database report, CDP and The Guardian.

   News analysis by Stephen Conmy The most polluting companies in the world have been revealed. Researchers have found that just 20 different state-owned and multinational companies drive the climate emergency that threatens humanity. Although these firms are conscious of their industry’s devastating impact on the planet, they have continued to expand their operations. 20 companies have contributed to 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane worldwide, totalling 480 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) since 1965. “The great tragedy of the climate crisis is that seven and a half billion people must pay the price – in the form of a degraded planet – so that a couple of dozen polluting interests can continue to make record profits. It is a great moral failing of our political system that we have allowed this to happen,” says Michael Mann, a leading climate specialist. The research by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute in the US shows that just 20 companies have contributed to 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane worldwide, totalling 480 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) since 1965. The question is, will the leaders of these firms be held accountable? Build a better future with the Diploma in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). Build a better future with the Diploma in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). Perhaps not by today’s grey-haired investors and governments. However, the generation born in the 21st Century is now entering the workforce and will be the leading legislators, investors, and consumers in the next decade or so. How will they look back? In anger, most likely. Organisations like the Climate Accountability Institute in the US want to hold big polluters to account but also “leverage accountability by carbon producers into using their skills, capital, and resources to aid rather than oppose the transition to a low-carbon or zero-carbon energy future”. Actively lying and lobbying to protect your polluting ways won’t go down well with future generations. It is also appalling governance. They say it’s not their fault; they simply serve a human demand for oil, coal and gas. Don’t forget, they also spend millions on lobbying governments and investors every year, showing off their ‘green credentials’. The fact that they put money into denial rather than investing in renewable energy may also come back to haunt them. Actively lying and lobbying to protect your polluting ways won’t go down well with future generations. It is also appalling governance. Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute says leading companies and industry associations were “aware of, or wilfully ignored, the threat of climate change from continued use of their products since the late 1950s”. The public and political debate should focus less on individual responsibility and more on holding companies, most responsible for carbon emissions, accountable, says Heede. According to the UN, we now have just ten years to prevent the worst effects of global warming and limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The five biggest oil and gas companies spent $200 million lobbying to delay, control or block policies addressing climate change. Yes. The problem is the biggest corporate polluters are very profitable in money terms, so they still attract a lot of investment which helps them expand their operations. There has been some investor backlash against the polluters and the environmental vandals. Some significant investment funds have said they will no longer support funds that have ‘dirty firms’ on their books. However, it’s the future backlash that may come back to haunt them in more intensive ways. Many of the top polluters spend millions each year lobbying governments and presenting themselves as eco-friendly. A recent study revealed that the five most significant oil and gas companies spent $200 million lobbying to delay, control or block policies addressing climate change. Heede said the companies have “significant moral, financial, and legal obligations and burdens related to the climate crisis”. “The fossil fuel companies have their collective hand on the throttle and the tiller determining the rate of carbon emissions and the shift to non-carbon fuels,” says Heede.
