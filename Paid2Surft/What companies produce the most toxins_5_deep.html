                    ChemSec identifies the top 12 PFAS producers in the world and reveals shocking societal costs PRESS RELEASE: The global societal costs of PFAS chemicals amount to €16 trillion per year  Published on 22 May 2023  The issue of PFAS chemicals, used for decades in many consumer products, has gained more and more attention among the public, media and policymakers. These toxic chemicals are in our water, environment, and even bodies.  Despite the urgency of the issue, there’s a shortage of information regarding which companies are the biggest producers of PFAS, how big the industry is and the societal cost of PFAS pollution. Through investigative efforts, the NGO ChemSec now reveals that the corporate profits from the production are surprisingly small – especially compared to the societal costs. And even though the magnitude of the PFAS problem is severe, only a dozen companies are responsible for most PFAS production worldwide.   In 2022, the global market size for PFAS was just over $28 billion, with estimated profits of around $4 billion[1]. You would be excused to think the profits would be much greater, given the significant problems caused by PFAS. But instead, the profits pale compared to the societal costs of these chemicals. By combining a range of studies and expert statements relating to costs connected to healthcare from exposure to PFAS and remediation of soils and water, ChemSec can reveal that the global societal costs are €16 trillion per year.  It goes without saying that the revenue and profits of PFAS are not even in the same range as the societal costs of these chemicals. Moreover, €16 trillion is a conservative estimate, excluding costs such as damages to animals or reduction of property prices. “PFAS chemicals pose a serious threat to our health and the environment. It’s crucial that we tackle this issue not only on a policy level but also on a business level. We need transparency and accountability from companies involved in PFAS production, and we need policy measures to reduce the use of these harmful chemicals”, says Anne-Sofie Bäckar, Executive Director at ChemSec.  If PFAS producers were to pay for the pollution they caused, many would go bankrupt. However, this considerable liability risk is rarely reflected in the sustainability reports of these companies.  ChemSec’s investigation of the twelve biggest PFAS producers shows that “PFAS” is rarely mentioned. In fact, seven out of twelve companies do not mention it all. Yet another three mention PFAS less than ten times. The two exceptions are 3M and Chemours, which both are involved in litigation cases due to PFAS production and are therefore required to mention this in their reporting.  As a telling contrast to the lack of mentions of PFAS, the word sustainability is collectively mentioned 1,913 times by the companies in the reports.  A central argument for keeping PFAS on the market is that these chemicals are essential in many areas, such as medicine and climate change mitigation. There is, however, a tendency to overestimate the role of PFAS as essential. For example, looking at the fluoropolymer market in the EU, a sub-category to PFAS where you find a majority of essential uses, only about 8 per cent of the total production volume goes towards the often-cited examples of renewable energy, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals (which, by the way, is exempted from the EU ban proposal). The rest goes towards transportation, textiles, electronics and cookware where there are, in most cases, viable alternatives. [1] Assuming a 16% profit margin, as communicated by American PFAS producer 3M, is a relevant industry benchmark.    ©2023 The International Chemical Secretariat. All rights reserverad.

                    e.g. About Enviro-Safe, Waste disposal, Support Explore Enviro-Safe&#x27;s wide range of services With the July 1 deadline for Toxic Release Inventory reporting rapidly approaching, companies across the U.S. are evaluating their calendar year’s toxic chemicals releases. It is common at this time of year to reevaluate and search for new strategies to manage, minimize and recycle chemical waste for a better report next year. In fact, implementing a cost-effective waste minimization and recycling program can result in benefits for the environment and your company. These include: For companies using TRI-listed chemicals, contacting consulting experts at Enviro-Safe Resource Recovery about waste minimization and proper recycling / disposal programs can be particularly beneficial. While many types of commercial and industrial activities cause waste, three industry sectors account for 72 percent of the reported quantities of TRI chemicals disposed of or otherwise released in 2017. Here are the top three generators of TRI-listed chemicals that may benefit most from proper waste minimization and recycling programs.  According to EPA data, the electric utilities industry sector accounted for 9 percent of all TRI chemicals reported last year. Electric utilities generate, transmit and distribute electric power. The primary toxic chemicals reported by the industry are those fuels which are used to generate power, namely coal and oil. With thorough recycling programs, it is possible to safely manage and store used oils to protect employees health. Recyclable chemicals that appeared in EPA reports included Ethylene Glycol (EG), Methanol, Toluene, Xylene and more. At Enviro-Safe, our knowledgeable and experienced staff of professionals manage the recycling, safe disposal and transportation of toxic chemicals.  Chemical manufacturing accounted for the second highest spot at thirteen percent on the EPA’s list. Chemical manufacturers produce industrial chemicals and convert raw materials like metals, natural gas, and minerals into thousands of products. Some of these products are used for commercial and manufacturing purposes, such as plastics, while some are produced for home use, such as cosmetics. From acetone to hydrogen peroxide to xylene, a chemical manufacturing company’s failure to properly dispose of or report toxic chemical releases could result in a variety of devastating consequences to humans and the environment. Many chemicals used and created by chemical manufacturers are known to cause birth defects or cancer, can create public health crises by entering the water supply, resulting in risks to employees health. But waste minimization techniques and recycling programs like those offered at Enviro-Safe can help. Our experts help your company reduce chemical waste through improved audits, better inventory management, equipment modifications, updated production and maintenance processes and more. We can also assist with hazardous chemical substitution or find secondary markets for slightly used chemicals, or used as supplemental fuels. In fact, the EPA reports many companies are trending towards resource recovery; in 2017, only 3 percent of this sector&#x27;s waste was released while the rest was managed through treatment, energy recovery, and recycling.    Metal mining far exceeded any other industry in terms of TRI-listed chemicals, accounting for a whopping 50 percent of all toxic chemical releases on the EPA’s list. Unfortunately, chemical waste from metal mining activity is extremely difficult to recycle. In fact, the EPA reported 97 percent of the metal mining sector&#x27;s production-related waste from 2017 was disposed of or otherwise released rather than recycled. The majority of this waste consisted of metals, with zinc and lead compounds at the top of the list. But this does not mean companies in the metal mining industry cannot benefit from recycling. Chemicals used to maintain machinery or as organic solvents in metal mining such as methanol or toluene are TRI-listed chemicals the EPA and States monitor. Metal mining companies must also adhere to Federal and State workplace safety standards. Enviro-Safe respects the generator and strives to go above and beyond Federal and State regulations while saving you money. All said, 98 percent of everything we touch is recycled. Recycling and waste minimization are ultimately the best ways to deal with hazardous and non-hazardous waste and protect the environment and human health. Working with recycling experts will ease the reporting burden on your employees and save you money. *We respect your privacy and do not tolerate spam.

                    This article reveals that DuPont and 3M, two leading manufacturers of PFAS 'Forever Chemicals', had evidence of PFAS toxicity as early as the 1960s, yet failed to inform the public and their employees of its dangers. The article shows how the companies attempted to cover up evidence of PFAS toxicity and the potential health risks associated with it.

                    The female employees at the DuPont chemical company’s Washington Works plant in Parkersburg, W. Va., were not given much of an explanation in 1981 when they were all abruptly moved away from any part of the factory that produced a category of chemicals then known as C8. They certainly were not told about their eight recently pregnant coworkers who had worked with C8 and given birth that year—one of them to a baby with eye defects and just a single nostril; another to a baby who had eye and tear duct defects; and a third with C8 in its cord blood.  For any employees with any doubts, the company took pains to offer reassurances that all was well. “During the period that C8 has been used at Washington Works,” a memo to the staff read, “there is no known evidence that our employees have been exposed to C8 at levels that pose adverse health effects. There is a dose level where almost every chemical, even water, becomes poisonous. [C8] has a lower toxicity, like table salt.” C8 is today defined as two chemicals—PFOA and PFOS—that are part of a class of more than 12,000 substances known collectively as PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Also known as “forever chemicals” because that’s pretty much how long they linger in the environment, PFAS are used in thousands of products from textiles to nonstick pans to cosmetics to fire-fighting foam to food packaging, and more. The chemicals have been linked to a host of physical ills, including decreased fertility, high blood pressure in pregnant people, increased risk of certain cancers, developmental delays and low birthweight in children, hormonal disruption, high cholesterol, and reduced effectiveness of the immune system. PFAS were first developed in the 1940s and it was not until the late 1990s that the public knew about the dangers they pose. But, according to a new study published in Annals of Global Health, DuPont and 3M—the leading manufacturers of the chemicals—had preliminary evidence of PFAS toxicity as early as the 1960s, and knew broadly about the dangers the chemicals pose by 1970.  These revelations of what the two companies knew about the harms of PFAS, and when, come as a result of an analysis of records on file at the University of California San Francisco’s (UCSF) Chemical Industry Documents Library. The documents, in turn, were the product of discovery in two lawsuits: 1998’s Tennant vs. DuPont, in which the plaintiff complained that DuPont dumped more than 7,100 tons of PFOA-laced sludge onto his property; and 2002’s Leach vs. DuPont, a class action suit in which more than 80,000 West Virginia plaintiffs charged the company with contaminating the local water supply with PFOA and PFOS. Read more: All The Stuff in Your Home That Might Contain PFAS ‘Forever Chemicals’ In 2020, a team of researchers from UCSF and the University of Colorado dove into the documents, seeking to compare the industry’s silence on—and in some cases direct cover-up of—the dangers of PFAS with similar actions by the tobacco and fossil fuel industries. The parallels, they found were striking, with the PFAS manufacturers suppressing unfavorable research, distorting public disclosure of research that does leak out, withholding information from employees who might be exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS, and not disclosing evidence of PFAS dangers to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as required under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). All of this could ultimately figure into future PFAS-related lawsuits, both from plaintiffs alleging illnesses from exposure to the chemicals and from communities seeking remediation and clean-up of contaminated soil and groundwater. Certainly, the records examined by the researchers show that the companies knew the risks associated with the substances they were manufacturing. “Having access to these documents allows us to see what the manufacturers knew and when, but also how polluting industries keep critical public health information private,” said Dr. Nadia Gaber, an emergency medicine resident and the first author of the paper, in a statement. “This research is important to inform policy and move us towards a precautionary rather than a reactionary principle of chemical regulation.” In an email to TIME, DuPont—which has since diversified—said, in part: “In 2019, DuPont de Nemours was established as a new multi-industrial specialty products company. DuPont de Nemours has never manufactured PFOA or PFOS. DuPont de Nemours cannot comment on allegations contained in the UCSF paper that relate to historical … matters.” 3M sent an emailed comment as well, stating: “The paper is largely comprised of previously published documents—as evidenced by the paper’s references section, which includes citations dating back as far as 1962. 3M has previously addressed many of the mischaracterizations of these documents in previous reporting.” It was in 1961 that the dissembling around the dangers of PFAS started. That year, as the new study details, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published a report of workers in PFAS factories who fell ill after smoking cigarettes that had been contaminated with PFAS-based Teflon. Shortly after, an account surfaced of a worker on a U.S. Air Force Base who somehow came into possession of a similarly contaminated cigarette, smoked it and died on site. DuPont and the Air Force dismissed the account as a rumor—and the author of the original Canadian paper, bowing to industry and military pressure, posted a retraction, saying in part, “The Union Carbide Corporation, upon further investigation, and with the cooperation of DuPont, reported in December of last year, ‘there have been no deaths or permanent injuries known to stem from Teflon; all rumors of death are false.’” But DuPont knew better. In 1962 a company scientist conducting in-house studies on Teflon that were not released to the public conceded that the substance may be reactive to excessive heat and handling. “Teflon may not be so inert,” the scientist concluded. A non-industry paper in 1965 showed that Teflon was associated with “an epidemic of polymer fume fever,” an inhalation fever that occurs when Teflon is heated to 300° C (572° F). DuPont remained silent on those findings. Read more: The Challenge of Removing Toxic PFAS ‘Forever Chemicals’ from Drinking Water That wasn’t all the companies were learning about the products they were manufacturing. A 1961 DuPont study found that Teflon exposure led to liver enlargement in rats, with the in-house scientist recommending that the material should be handled “with extreme care” and that “contact with the skin should be strictly avoided.” In 1970, researchers at the Washington Works plant found that C8—or PFOA and PFOS—could be “highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested.” These findings were not made public either. A 1979 industry study showed opacity in the corneas of rats exposed to PFAS; and industry studies in 1979 and 1981 showed liver degeneration in rats fed both high and low doses of PFAS. Among the human studies the companies conducted, in 1994 researchers found that the half-life of C8 in the blood of employees was 1.5 to three years. The researchers nonetheless concluded from that same study that “no adverse health effects were found in 3M workers in a study of liver function in DuPont Washington Works.” But they added, “a possible increase in prostate cancers” had been reported at a different 3M plant manufacturing C8. Other findings among employees showed elevated liver enzymes in 61% of 30 workers tested, indicating inflammation and damage to cells in the liver; and both 3M and DuPont found elevated fluorine—a marker of PFAS—in the blood of employees. The higher the level of fluorine, the higher the level of PFAS, and the greater the risk of all of the illnesses associated with the chemicals. Other industry and non-industry studies from 1988 to 2020 showed a range of additional ills associated with PFAS, including testicular adenomas—or non-malignant growths; neurological damage; metabolic dysfunction; and fertility problems. As the evidence of the dangers of PFAS mounted—both from company research and independent studies—3M and DuPont began covering up what they were learning, describes the new study. In 1991, researchers unaffiliated with the companies began detecting PFAS in ground water. The companies responded with a joint press release stating: “According to studies by DuPont and 3M Corporation, C8 has no known toxic or ill health effects in humans at concentration levels detected.” In 2000, health officials in Lubeck, W. Va., found that several forms of PFAS, including C8, were present in the local drinking water. In response, DuPont reassured the officials that all was well. The officials repeated the company line publicly, stating that, “DuPont reports that it has toxicological and epidemiological data to support confidence that exposure guidelines established by DuPont are protective of human health.” But by now, the genie was out of the bottle. Researchers unaffiliated with the companies were publishing more and more studies on the risks of PFAS linking it to increased risk of certain cancers and other ills; the Tennant case had already been adjudicated and the Leach case was coming. And in 2000, 3M even announced it would no longer be manufacturing the PFAS-based fabric-protecting Scotchguard. In an in-house email discussing the announcement, a DuPont attorney acknowledged that the chemical is “too persistent in the environment and gets into our blood.” He added, “The plant recognizes it must get public first…better late than never.”  In 2002, after Leach was adjudicated, a DuPont vice president tried to enlist help from an unlikely source: the EPA. “Urgent: EPA action needed,” the vice president wrote to the agency. “We need the EPA to quickly (like first thing tomorrow) say the following…Consumer products sold under the Teflon brand are safe [and] there are no human health effects known to be caused by PFOA.” The EPA did not accommodate the company’s request. By now, of course, the dangers of PFAS are well known, with the chemical turning up in all manner of previously unexpected places, including toilet paper, menstrual products, and contact lenses. The EPA has already regulated permissible levels of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, and is working to add six more types to that list by 2026. Public demand is leading to a growing market for PFAS-free products, leaving companies like DuPont and 3M either to abandon—or at least curb—the chemicals or get left behind. As for the companies’ reputations, studies like the just-released one might make cleaning them up a difficult job. “These documents reveal clear evidence that the chemical industry knew about the dangers of PFAS and failed to let public regulators, and even their employees know the risks,” said Tracey Woodruff, director of the UCSF program on reproductive health and senior author of the paper, in a statement. “As many countries pursue legal and legislative action to curb PFAS production, we hope they are aided by the timeline of evidence presented in this paper.” Correction: The original version of this story misspelled the name of the senior author of the paper. It is Tracey Woodruff, not Tracy Woodruff. Write to Jeffrey Kluger at jeffrey.kluger@time.com.
