The Plastic Waste Makers Index, published Tuesday, names the companies that are at the forefront of the plastic supply chain and manufacture polymers, known as the building block of plastics. It also highlighted that the firms identified are supported by a small number of financial backers. Single-use plastics, such as bottles, bags and food packages, are the most commonly discarded type of plastic. Made almost exclusively from fossil fuels, these &quot;throwaway&quot; plastics often end their short lifecycle polluting the oceans, being burned or dumped into landfills. The study says 20 petrochemical companies are responsible for 55% of the world&#x27;s single-use plastic waste. The findings were published by the Minderoo Foundation, one of Asia&#x27;s largest philanthropies. The research was conducted by academics from the London School of Economics, the Stockholm Environment Institute, Wood Mackenzie, among others. U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil tops the list, contributing 5.9 million metric tons to global plastic waste, closely followed by U.S. chemicals company Dow and China&#x27;s Sinopec. The study says 100 companies are the source of 90% of global single-use plastic production. Nearly 60% of the commercial finance funding the plastic waste crisis comes from just 20 global banks, the study said. A total of $30 billion of loans from these institutions, including Barclays, HSBC and Bank of America, has supported the sector since 2011. The research also assessed the countries that are the biggest contributors to the single-use plastic crisis, based on per head of population. Australia and the U.S., respectively, were found to produce the greatest amounts of &quot;throwaway&quot; plastics, at more than 50 kg per person per year in 2019. South Korea and the U.K. were found to generate 44 kg of single-use plastic waste per person. By contrast, the average person in China — the largest producer of single-use plastic by volume — produces 18 kg of single-use plastic per year. For India, that figure is as low as 4 kg per year, the study said. &quot;The trajectories of the climate crisis and the plastic waste crisis are strikingly similar and increasingly intertwined,&quot; former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said in a statement accompanying the research. &quot;As awareness of the toll of plastic pollution has grown, the petrochemical industry has told us it&#x27;s our own fault and has directed attention toward behavior change from end-users of these products, rather than addressing the problem at its source,&quot; he added. Environmental activists have previously laid the blame for plastic waste at companies such as PespiCo and Coca-Cola. However, this study suggests that a group of petrochemical companies are actually the source of the crisis — one that has devastating ecological, social and environmental consequences. After Exxon Mobil, Dow and Sinpoec, the study says these firms are the biggest producers of single-use plastic: Indorama Ventures, Saudi Aramco, PetroChina, LyondellBasell, Reliance Industries, Braskem, Alpek SA de CV, Borealis, Lotte Chemical, INEOS, Total, Jiangsu Hailun Petrochemical, Far Eastern New Century, Formosa Plastics Corporation, China Energy Investment Group, PTT and China Resources. CNBC contacted the top companies identified as being responsible for the plastic waste crisis and the leading banks enabling waste generation. In response, a spokesperson at ExxonMobil said the company &quot;shares society&#x27;s concern about plastic waste and agrees it must be addressed.&quot; &quot;ExxonMobil is taking action to address plastic waste by increasing plastic recyclability, supporting improvements in plastic waste recovery – for example, through our founding membership in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste – and minimizing plastic pellet loss from our operations,&quot; the spokesperson added. A spokesperson for Formosa Plastics Corporation pointed out that the company was a founding member of The Alliance to End Plastic Waste. &quot;We are committed to helping end plastic waste in the environment, closing circularity gaps including design for circularity, and programs using recycled plastic waste as feedstock for new materials,&quot; they added. Bank of America refused to comment. The other companies contacted did not respond. &quot;Our reliance on oil and gas is not only fueling climate change, but as the primary material used in the production of throwaway plastics is also devastating our oceans,&quot; said Sam Fankhauser, professor of Climate Change Economics and Policy at the Smith School, University of Oxford. &quot;It is critically important petrochemical companies move towards circular-economy-based alternatives if we are going to successfully tackle these interlinked crises,&quot; Fankhauser said. The report warns that plastic production is set to grow by 30% in the next five years, creating even more plastic waste and exacerbating the climate emergency. &quot;This is the first-time the financial and material flows of single-use plastic production have been mapped globally and traced back to their source,&quot; said Toby Gardner, senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute. &quot;Revealing the sheer scale of the global crisis we have on our hands, it&#x27;s critical we break the pattern of inaction. You can&#x27;t manage what you can&#x27;t measure. Building on the analysis published today, this is why it is so important the small group of companies and banks that dominate global production of throwaway plastics begin to disclose their own data.&quot; Got a confidential news tip?

                    Plastic Waste Makers index identifies those driving climate crisis with virgin polymer production Twenty companies are responsible for producing more than half of all the single-use plastic waste in the world, fuelling the climate crisis and creating an environmental catastrophe, new research reveals. Among the global businesses responsible for 55% of the world’s plastic packaging waste are both state-owned and multinational corporations, including oil and gas giants and chemical companies, according to a comprehensive new analysis. The top 20 producers of single use plastic The Plastic Waste Makers index reveals for the first time the companies who produce the polymers that become throwaway plastic items, from face masks to plastic bags and bottles, which at the end of their short life pollute the oceans or are burned or thrown into landfill. It also reveals Australia leads a list of countries for generating the most single-use plastic waste on a per capita basis, ahead of the United States, South Korea and Britain. ExxonMobil is the greatest single-use plastic waste polluter in the world, contributing 5.9m tonnes to the global waste mountain, concludes the analysis by the Minderoo Foundation of Australia with partners including Wood Mackenzie, the London School of Economics and Stockholm Environment Institute. The largest chemicals company in the world, Dow, which is based in the US, created 5.5m tonnes of plastic waste, while China’s oil and gas enterprise, Sinopec, created 5.3m tonnes. Eleven of the companies are based in Asia, four in Europe, three in North America, one in Latin America, and one in the Middle East. Their plastic production is funded by leading banks, chief among which are Barclays, HSBC, Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. The enormous plastic waste footprint of the top 20 global companies amounts to more than half of the 130m metric tonnes of single-use plastic thrown away in 2019, the analysis says. Single-use plastics are made almost exclusively from fossil fuels, driving the climate crisis, and because they are some of the hardest items to recycle, they end up creating global waste mountains. Just 10%-15% of single-use plastic is recycled globally each year. The analysis provides an unprecedented glimpse into the small number of petrochemicals companies, and their financial backers, which generate almost all single-use plastic waste across the world. Al Gore, the environmentalist and former US vice-president, said the groundbreaking analysis exposed how fossil fuel companies were rushing to switch to plastic production as two of their main markets – transport and electricity generation – were being decarbonised. “Since most plastic is made from oil and gas – especially fracked gas – the production and consumption of plastic are becoming a significant driver of the climate crisis,” said Gore. “Moreover, the plastic waste that results – particularly from single-use plastics – is piling up in landfills, along roadsides, and in rivers that carry vast amounts into the ocean.” The plastic waste crisis grows every year. In the next five years, global capacity to produce virgin polymers for single-use plastics could grow by more than 30%. By 2050 plastic is expected to account for 5%-10% of greenhouse gas emissions. “An environmental catastrophe beckons: much of the resulting single-use plastic waste will end up as pollution in developing countries with poor waste management systems,” the report’s authors said. “The projected rate of growth in the supply of these virgin polymers … will likely keep new, circular models of production and reuse ‘out of the money’ without regulatory stimulus.” The report said the plastics industry across the world had been allowed to operate with minimal regulation and limited transparency for decades. “These companies are the source of the single-use plastic crisis: their production of new ‘virgin’ polymers from oil, gas and coal feedstocks perpetuates the take-make-waste dynamic of the plastics economy.” The report said this undermines the shift to a circular economy, including the production of recycled polymers from plastic waste, reusing plastic and using substitute materials. Just 2% of single-use plastic was made from recycled polymers in 2019. “Plastic pollution is one of the greatest and most critical threats facing our planet,” said Dr Andrew Forrest AO, chairman of the Minderoo Foundation. “The current outlook is set to get worse and we simply cannot allow these producers of fossil fuel-derived plastics to continue as they have done without check. With our oceans choking and plastic impacting our health, we need to see firm intervention from producers, governments and the world of finance to break the cycle of inaction.”

 A worker operates a forklift to move household waste at a facility that stores recyclable materials in Seoul, South Korea. In 2019, more than 130 million metric tons of single-use plastics were thrown away, according to a new report. In 2019, more than 130 million metric tons of single-use plastics were thrown away, with most of that waste burned, buried in a landfill or dumped directly into the ocean or onto land. Now, a new report finds that just 20 companies account for more than half of all single-use plastic waste generated worldwide. The report, published Tuesday by Australia&#x27;s Minderoo Foundation, offers one of the fullest accountings, to date, of the companies behind the production of single-use plastics that researchers believe could account for as much as 10% of global greenhouse emissions by 2050. Single-use plastics are meant to be thrown out immediately after use, such as bags, drinking straws, bottles and packaging.  The study identifies 20 companies as the source of 55% of the world&#x27;s single-use plastic waste, while the top 100 companies account for more than 90%. Nearly all the single-use plastic manufactured by these companies — 98% according to the report — is made from &quot; &#x27;virgin&#x27; (fossil-fuel-based) feedstocks&quot; rather than recycled materials. At the top of what the foundation calls its &quot;Plastic Waste Makers Index&quot; is the energy giant Exxon Mobil, followed by the Dow Chemical Co. and China&#x27;s Sinopec. The report found that Exxon Mobil was responsible for 5.9 million metric tons of such waste in 2019, while Dow and Sinopec contributed 5.6 million and 5.3 million, respectively. Taken together, the three companies account for 16% of all waste from single-use plastics such as bottles, bags and food packaging, according to the report. In a statement, Exxon Mobil said it &quot;shares society&#x27;s concern about plastic waste.&quot; The company said it is &quot;taking action to address plastic waste&quot; but said the problem requires collective action from &quot;industry, governments, nongovernmental organizations and consumers&quot; alike. The report also traced the money invested in the production of single-use plastics, finding that 20 institutional asset managers hold shares worth close to $300 billion in the parent companies that make up the foundation&#x27;s rankings. The top three investors are U.S.-based Vanguard Group, BlackRock and Capital Group, which according to the report have an estimated $6 billion invested in the production of single-use plastics. &quot;The trajectories of the climate crisis and the plastic waste crisis are strikingly similar — and increasingly intertwined,&quot; former Vice President Al Gore said in a statement that accompanied the report. &quot;Since most plastic is made from oil and gas — especially fracked gas — the production and consumption of plastic are becoming a significant driver of the climate crisis, already producing greenhouse gas emissions on the same scale as a large country and causing the emission of other harmful toxins from plastics facilities into nearby communities — disproportionately harming people of color and those in low-income communities,&quot; he wrote. The report warned that in the next five years, the global capacity to produce the materials needed for single-use plastics could grow by more than 30%. &quot;An environmental catastrophe beckons: much of the resulting single-use plastic waste will end up as pollution in developing countries with poor waste management systems,&quot; according to the report. Solving the issue will require drastic changes from producers, investors and banks, the authors wrote. The report said that producers of polymers — known as the building blocks of plastics — should begin disclosing their single-use plastic waste &quot;footprint,&quot; while banks and investors should move to &quot;phase out entirely&quot; any financing that goes toward the production of single-use plastics. But confronting the challenge will also require &quot;immense political will,&quot; according to the authors, who noted that roughly 30% of the sector, by value, is state-owned.
