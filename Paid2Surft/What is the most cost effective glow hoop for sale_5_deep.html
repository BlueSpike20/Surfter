For older people, who need a hula hoop for toning muscles and exercising, a sturdy hoop with a good diameter to fit the waist properly might be better. Since there are different hoops with different LED colors, you can make your decision based on the number of LED lights you want your hula hoop to have. For instance, if you are looking for an LED hula hoop for artistic expression or for kids, you might need one with more LED lights. Above we have guided you about factors to consider before buying the LED hula hoops. Now let’s learn some of the benefits of doing hula hoops. LED hula hoops make for great gifts for people of all ages. These make for great workout gear if you are looking for some fun while working out. Fitness coaches often include hula hoop exercises in their routines for clients seeking real results in abdominal muscle development. Hannah Shine, certified personal trainer, at Australian Fitness Academy, says, “LED hula hoops are an amazing non-impact exercise option, which means they don’t put any stress on the joints of your body, especially on the lower parts of the body like knees and ankles. This is because when you hula hoop, the movement is done in a circular motion and it’s done by the hips and abdominal muscles, unlike exercises like running or jumping that are done by the lower body. This feature of hula hooping makes it a great option for people with joint pain or people who are recovering from injuries.” They help burn calories and improve cardiovascular health and fitness.

These qualities make the UltraHoop a great entry point for newcomers, and an affordable option for experienced flow artists. In this article, we’ll be covering the benefits of LED hula hoops, the best upgrades for the UltraHoop Shuffle, and how to use the UltraHoop Shuffle. By the end of the article, you should have all the information you need to purchase one of UltraPoi’s light up hula hoops. If you decide that LED hula hoops won’t suit your performance needs, we recommend browsing our full collection of poi balls and other flow art toys. Due to their circular form and multiple pixels of light, LED hula hoops are excellent tools for creating light show performances. They’re light-weight compared to other flow toys, like LED poi, and are more familiar to use as many people have tried a hula hoop as a child. The UltraHoop Shuffle does not have any tiny buttons, switches or complex menus, it only has a ON or OFF state for the LEDs, which automatically cycle through colors modes and strobe patterns, making it especially simple to control. Newcomers to Flow Arts should find the UltraHoop Shuffle easy to grasp, although certain moves may require a basic familiarity with hula hooping. Still, beginners can achieve attractive light trails with the LED hula hoop right out of the box. Mastering those advanced hooping techniques, however, will take a lot longer, and experts will know how to augment their Flow by using multiple, different sized hoops to perform more complex spins. Although using the UltraHoop as a beginner can be easy to get started due to basic familiarity with Hula Hoops, the skill ceiling can still be quite high if you learn advanced technical on body and off body hooping tricks. You could say this particular glow hoop is easy to pick up and play, but difficult to master, and if you’re pursuing mastery, you’ll want to consider some upgrades. By altering certain aspects of the UltraHoop Shuffle LED hula hoop, such as its size, the material it’s made from, and by adding a counter weight, you can fine tune your hoop(s) to meet your performance needs. UltraHoops are available in lots of different sizes, materials, and finishes, giving you plenty of options to alter them for your specific performance needs. Choosing the right size, material, and finish for your LED hula hoops can enhance your ability to perform complex moves. The result is a customized Flow Art Prop that fits perfectly with Hoopers style and body type. The standard UltraHoop Shuffle package from UltraPoi comes with 1x UltraHoop LED Shuffle Hula Hoop (36”, ⅝ HDPE, bare finish), 1x rechargeable battery, and 1x battery charger. This set is great for beginners who don’t need much to get started, but if you’re a more advanced hooper, you should consider the following upgrades. The sizes of our UltraHoops range from 36” all the way down to 18” and include every number in between. The smaller hoops (18”-23”) are considered “mini”. Here&#x27;s a tip on choosing size, big hoops are easier to hoop with since they can spin more slowly around your body. And the opposite is true for smaller hoops since they need to be spun faster to keep them going. As a hooper advances in skill they will get more comfortable with smaller hoop sizes. Recommended size ranges: 36”-33” Beginner Sizes, 34”-31” Intermediate Sizes, 31”-26” Advanced Sizes. There may be one size that appeals to you most for on body waist hooping type tricks, and a different size that you like for off body or juggling techniques. Depending on how you like to perform and how much space you have to work with you can decide what size hoop will fit you best. Once you’ve chosen the size for your UltraHoop for a specific style you can consider other creative options. For example, an advanced hooper might want to spin a particular hoop size around their waist and utilize a pair of mini hoops in their hands or around their arms. Get creative! For the material of your UltraHoop, you can choose between high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PolyPro) plastic. HDPE flow hoops are more durable and rigid, whereas PolyPro hoops are more flexible and brittle. Some people prefer one material over the other, but beginners likely won’t notice much of a difference between using HDPE and PolyPro hoops. We recommend HDPE for beginners and PolyPro for advanced users. Also note that PolyPro can become brittle and crack in very cold temperatures so hoopers in cold climates should take note. In addition to choosing the type of material, you can also choose the thickness of your UltraHoop to fit your style or hand size. We will list some of the pros and cons that come along with choosing thickness. The 5/8“ tubing may be smaller, lighter and more comfortable in your hand but it comes with a AAA size battery with less power capacity. The 3/4“ tubing is larger, heavier but comes with a AA size battery with twice the life span. One of our favorite sizes is the 11/16“ since it&#x27;s in between the previous two sizes and is actually the most durable due to a thicker interior wall. Here are the sizes for both materials: Besides the standard bare finish of the UltraHoop, UltraPoi offers hoops with sanded finishes and 3m grip tape. Each finish differs in how easy they are to grip. The bare finish provides a neutral grip for various performance needs, while the sanded finish is more sleek, allowing it to easily slide through your hands. The 3m grip tape provides the firmest grip for precise spins, and flips. Your choice of finish won’t necessarily prevent you from achieving any common spins, but they can enhance your ability to perform specific moves. So, think about what moves you like to perform most and choose your hoop’s finish accordingly. In the “Hoop Extras” tab beneath the product title, you’ll find both battery and counter weight upgrades for your LED hula hoop. Each UltraHoop requires a 1x custom rechargeable 3.7 volt Li-ion type battery to power the electronics. This is a specific type of battery and normal energizer or duracell type batteries will not work. Please only use the batteries we sell on our site for your UltraHoop and also note that you should only insert 1 battery at time. You can upgrade to multiple batteries which is great so you will always have a charged battery backup so you can continue hooping uninterrupted. Conveniently, the charger for said batteries is included with every UltraHoop set, so if even if you want to buy more rechargeable batteries separately, you’ll already have a charger for them. Although the UltraHoop is very well balanced, you can additionally add a counter weight to your order which will be installed internally opposite the battery for more exact hoop balance. If you plan on doing any type of balancing tricks or off body type stalls, we recommend adding a counter weight to your UltraHoop. In the Hoop Extras section you can choose to add a Counter Weight, 2x Batteries, 2x Batteries &amp; Counter Weight or 3x Extra Batteries. We recommend getting the 2x Batteries &amp; Counter Weight so that you will have great balance and plenty of power to keep hooping all night long. Setting up and using the UltraHoop Shuffle LED hula hoop is simple, follow our guide below to get started. Quick Start Guide: No matter your skill level, the UltraHoop Shuffle hula hoop is an amazing value for an LED Hoop starting at $119.95! Many LED Hoops that can do smart color modes and strobe patterns like the UltraHoop can cost upwards of $300-$600 making this hoop a great choice for those on a budget. It may also be the right extra LED Hoop for you to take to a festival or to have doubles or triples for multi hoop tricks or juggling.

 Hoop comes with our Lifetime Warranty to protects against defects. Add optional Astral Care to also protect against accidental damage such as tubing breaks and water exposure. *All sizes in stock and ready to ship* Introducing our most affordable high-quality remote controlled light up hula hoop.  The Starlight hoop is like no other.  40 psychedelic patterns designed to create mesmerizing effects when the hoop is in motion.  Easily customize the color and speed of each pattern using the remote and save them to the favorites bank. Most smart hoops have LEDs that shine only to the outside edge of the hoop.  The Starlight is different.  The LEDs shine a full 360 degrees around, lighting up the hoop tubing.  Because of this, fewer LEDs are needed to create stunning effects.  That also means the batteries last longer on a charge, making this a perfect hoop for long flow jams, performances, and festival use! The removable lithium-ion battery, counterweight, and circuitry weight a total of only 1 ounce, making this LED hoop feel just like a regular non-LED hoop.  The LEDs are spaced evenly around the hoop with no uneven light gaps.  These cannot be customized or modified.  Looking for custom options?  Check out our Custom Atomic V Hoops.
