                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: Experts share everything you need to know to create a garden blooming with flowers and foliage you can use to create beautiful indoor arrangements. Nancy is a freelance writer for MarthaStewart.com. 
There's a way to keep your lush, flower-filled backyard garden intact but still have gorgeous blooms to make arrangements with: Plant an additional garden (called a cutting garden) and fill it with flowers that are meant to be displayed in a vase. You get the best of both worlds!
 
These plants can be annuals or perennials for a variety of options, says Teri Speight, a master gardener, writer, podcaster, blogger, and the author of Black Flora: Profiles of Inspiring Black Flower Farmers and Florists. "With a diverse selection of plant material, a cutting garden can offer not just blooms, but foliage, as well," she says. Here's how to choose the best location for your cutting garden, along which flowers, herbs, and plants are the best to grow, according to experts.
 
Before choosing you flowers, you'll need to figure out where to plant them so your garden will flourish. There are a few factors that make for a great cut flower garden location: access to sunlight, a well-drained area, and healthy soil, say Jennifer and Adam O'Neal, the owners of PepperHarrow Farm and co-authors of Small Farm, Big Dreams: Turning A Flower-Growing Passion into a Successful Floral Business.
 
The first step is to find a location in your yard that receives adequate sunlight. "Most cut flowers prefer full sun, so picking a spot that achieves at least six hours of sunlight per day is ideal," say the O'Neals. This will also satisfy any cut flowers that require partial sun, they add. (Be sure to check the back of the seed packets for sunlight requirements.)
 
It's also important to find a well-drained area that won't hold rain water. "Flowers don't like to be kept overly moist, and too much water, especially standing water, will impede your flowers from growing and thriving," say the O'Neals. "If you're dealing with areas like this, the best thing you can do is to actively work on ways to help excess water drain away from the location."
 
The O'Neals recommend adding compost to your soil, constructing french drains, or building the area up slightly and adding raised bed gardens to help the water drain away from your cut flower garden.
 
A cutting garden also needs fertile, workable soil (typically topsoil and compost). "The first thing we always recommend is having a soil test completed for the location you're looking to add a cut flower garden," say the O'Neals. "Obtaining a soil test will help you to determine what nutrients you might be missing in your soil, so you can add those missing nutrients back into the soil."
 
When choosing flowers, consider a mix of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures (this allows for the most striking arrangements!), says Adam Dooling, the curator of Outdoor Garden and Herbaceous Collections at the New York Botanical Garden in Bronx, N.Y. To make it even more eye-catching, add in some foliage such as hosta leaves, as well as ferns and ornamental grasses. "Beyond aesthetics and fragrance, there are some objective qualities that make for a good cut, such as long, strong stems and a good 'vase life'—meaning, the amount of time a cut flower will still look good and retain its appearance in a vase," says Dooling.
 
Zinnias come in a variety of colors and grow large blooms. With full sun access, these flowers can reach up to 4 inches in height. "This is a flower we recommend giving a 'pinch' when they reach 12 to 18 inches tall to promote branching and flowering on the plant," say the O'Neals. "The more you cut zinnias, the more blooms they produce."
 
Do note that you should cut a zinnia when it's fully mature. The best way to tell that it's reached this point is by giving it a wiggle test, they say. Bounce the stem between your index and middle finger, and if the stem is rigid, it's ready to be cut. When the stem is floppy, it's not ready to cut and won't stand up straight in the vase. After cutting your zinnias, they will last for about seven to 10 days, however, they are known as a "dirty" flower, say the O'Neals. "Their stems are hairy, so they make vase water murky quickly," they say. "We recommend changing the water for a vase with these flowers once a day, retrimming the bottom of the stems each time."
 
When exposed to full sun, the celosia, specifically Celosia argantea, will grow vibrant, feathery blooms, which the O'Neals say are a great filler in bouquets. "This type of celosia can be pinched at 18 inches if you want to keep it a bit shorter," they say. Like zinnias, make sure the stem is rigid before cutting.
 
For a beautiful blue bloom, consider growing salvias. The Salvia blue bedder is a favorite of the O'Neals, and it can be grown as a perennial in zones 8 to 10. "Salvia serves as a supporting filler and adds a striking pop of color in a bouquet," they say. "Salvia is a bloom we give the wiggle test to, to see if it's mature to cut."
 
Some of the best peony varieties to grow for cutting are Paeonia lactiflora 'Vogue,' Coral Charm, and 'Baroness Schroeder,' says Speight. "Herbaceous peonies should be planted in the fall where they rise from the earth the following spring," she says. While peonies can take a growing season or two to bloom, they will grow in a variety of colorful hues.
 
Producing daisy-like flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, cosmos are another great cutting flower, say the O'Neals. "Their blooms are incredibly delicate and add the sparkle element to a bouquet," they say.
 
While they need full sun and typically grow in the 32- to 48-inch range, cosmos can be kept at a shorter length when they are pinched at 18 inches (this promotes branching!). "Cut blooms from them regularly, or remove old blooms to promote flowering," say the O'Neals. "Cosmos should be cut when the first petal is just beginning to curl open to give them the maximum vase life."
 
These flowers grow in shades of blush, orange, red, white, and yellow, and produce paper-like petals. Since they bloom into different shapes, the O'Neals love using this as a "filler flower" in an arrangement. These can be grown as annuals in zones 2 to 7 and as perennials in zones 8 to 10. "We give strawflowers the wiggle test to make sure the bloom is mature to cut," they say. "When cut at the proper stage, strawflowers can have a vase life from seven to 10 days."
 
There are many perks to the everlasting daisy. "Also known as Rhodanthe chlorocephala, [this] is an old-fashioned cut flower that can also be used as an everlasting (meaning you can dry the blooms for use in arrangements later)," says Speight. "The paper-like blooms should be harvested when partially opened. They will finish opening after harvesting within the arrangement."
 
They might not be an obvious choice, but herbs, like apple mint or cinnamon basil, are perfect to include in an arrangement. "They serve as greenery in a bouquet that provides an interesting texture and adds a lovely fragrance," say the O'Neals. "These herbs make a cut flower garden even more inviting."
 
For apple mint, consider planting in a container since they will spread if they are placed in your garden. This variety typically grows up to 36 inches in height and grows well as a perennial. Cinnamon basil can grow right in your garden and reach between 18 to 24 inches in height. This basil thrives in zones 5 to 8 as an annual, and grows best in zones 9 to 10 as a perennial. "We often wait to harvest basil until it begins to go to seed, and it also likes to be harvested early in the morning before the heat of the day sets in," say the O'Neals. "The vase life for both of these is about seven to 10 days."
 
For another filler in an arrangement, consider adding ferns to your cutting garden. These typically need part shade to thrive in the garden. Once you cut and add to a bouquet or tabletop display, the greenery will add fullness, especially alongside taller plants, says Speight. "In particular, the Japanese Painted Fern (Athyrium niponicum) adds a silvery tone that can balance, blend, and soften arrangements as needed," she says. "This particular cultivar grows easily in semi-shaded and damp areas." Ferns typically last as long as the rest of the arrangement, typically between seven to 10 days, as long as it stays hydrated.
 
When your garden is in full bloom, here are some tips for cutting and arranging your flowers, herbs, and plants to make beautiful bouquets.
 
With a few exceptions, like dahlias and zinnias that should be cut when in full bloom, the flowers should be cut when color begins to appear on their buds, says Dooling. If you don't have floral snips, use a sharp knife or scissors to get the job done. It's best to cut the flowers in the morning when it's still cool, rather than when it's hot in the afternoon or evening.
 
To keep cut flowers fresh as long as possible, start by putting them in a clean vase. Remove any leaves that fall below the water line in your vase, since those are what cause bacteria to grow, says Dooling.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize it into a no more than 50 word response: If you’re looking for the best flowers that offer vibrant color all summer long, check out these dozen no-fail, flowering plants. No doubt you’ve heard that a well-designed garden should include plants prized for their striking foliage, as well as some that produce fall color or berries, and others that provide good structure in winter. But let’s face it: most of us want flowers. Lots of them. All the time.  That’s where the summer flowering plants below come in. They’ll churn out blooms for weeks on end this summer. In most cases, you can harvest armloads to fill vases or give away, and still have plenty left to enjoy in your garden beds long past Labor Day. Related Also known as rose-mallow and swamp hibiscus, this garden standout was bred from wildflowers native to the East and South. Huge red, pink or white flowers can be as much as a foot across on stems that range from 2 to 8 feet high, depending on the variety. Flowers bloom from late spring until frost. Stems die back to the ground each winter. Care: Requires full sun; regular to abundant water. Grows as a perennial in zones 5-10. Before 1995, when this hybrid was named an All-America Selection winner, gardeners thought of petunias as upright plants. Purple Wave petunias (and later Wave introductions in pinks and lilac) are more like vines—perfect for growing in hanging pots, along retaining walls or even as a ground cover. Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Grows as an annual in all zones. Grow zinnias if you want to be able to cut armloads of flowers for bouquets and still have a bright band of color alongside a path or a lawn. All zinnias thrive in hot weather, but Profusion zinnias keep on blooming well into fall, whatever the weather.  Profusion White, Orange and Cherry, which have daisy-like flowers, each have won multiple garden awards. If you want fluffy pom-poms, look for double Profusion varieties in cherry, gold, white and “fire,” an orange-red. Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Grows as an annual in all zones. For year-round enjoyment, these clover-like flower heads are hard to beat. The papery flowers last a long time in the garden and in fresh bouquets, and the blooms are easy to dry for use in wintertime arrangements. Depending on the variety, flowers are white, red, pink, lilac or purple. ‘Strawberry Fields,’ with bright red blossoms, and ‘All Around Purple’ are two standouts. Care: Requires full sun to partial shade; moderate water. Grows as an annual in all zones. If you want to add contrast to a flowerbed or to fresh or dried flower arrangements, this dramatic spiky plant is a great choice. It resembles thistle, but the flower colors blend in more with the prickly blue-green leaves, which are often streaked with silver. Alpine sea holly (E. alpinum) is a deep steel blue, while E. amethystinum is more silvery blue. Miss Willmott’s Ghost (E. giganteum) produces especially striking conical flowers, each surrounded by a wreath of silvery, spikey bracts. Care: Requires full sun; moderate to regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 3-8. Tough and trouble-free, daylilies produce showy flowers above a mound of sword-shaped leaves. Whether in the garden or in a vase, each blossom lasts just one day; they are daylilies, after all. But each stem holds numerous buds that open on successive days. Low-growing Stella de Oro keeps churning out new stems with a profusion of golden-yellow blossoms for up to five months, far longer than most daylilies.  Care: Requires full sun to light shade; regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 3-9. Small clusters of delicate white flowers appear in low-growing clumps in spring and continue into the fall. The shiny, dark-green leaves stay on all winter, so the plant remains attractive year-round.  Care: Requires full sun to part shade; regular water. Grows as a perennial in zones 5-9. Brilliant yellow or orange flowers with a raised brown polka-dot center stand out in a perennial border. R. hirta varieties bloom from seed the first year and are grown as annuals; in the warmest areas, they’re wintertime bloomers.  Most other kinds are perennial and gradually form showy, spreading clumps as hardy as their wildflower ancestors, native to the East. All are good cut flowers as well. One to search out: R. fulgida var. sullivantii ‘Goldsturm,’ an especially flower-covered variety.  Care: Requires full sun; moderate to regular water. Grows as an annual or perennial, depending on the variety (as noted), in all zones. Despite the scary name, this is a lovely wildflower native to our Eastern meadows that draws butterflies and birds. One especially showy variety, E. maculatum ‘Gateway,’ has wine-red stems 5 to 7 feet tall, topped by dusky rose nosegays a foot across. Use as a tall anchor in a perennial bed or as a temporary screen, since stems die back to the ground in winter.  Care: Requires full sun; average to abundant water. Grows as a perennial in zones 4-8. Pink to purple daisy-like flowers about 4 inches across cover this perennial from mid-summer into autumn. The plant is especially hardy and unfussy, and you can divide clumps after several years to get new plants. The flowers draw butterflies and last well as cut flowers. ‘PowWow Wild Berry,’ which has rosy pink flowers, has been chosen as an All-America Selections winner. With large, easy-to-plant seeds and magnificently showy flowers, sunflowers are perhaps the perfect flower for kids to grow. Classic single-stem kinds such as ‘Mammoth Russian’ and ‘Russian Giant’ grow 10-15 feet tall and produce plate-size flowers with edible seeds.  Newer, shorter kinds include ‘Ring of Fire,” which is about 4-5 feet tall and has 5-inch flowers that work in a vase, and ‘Sunspot,’ which grows just 2 feet tall. ‘Indian Blanket’ is a branching kind with numerous smaller flowers suitable for cutting. Sunflower blooms face the sun, so choose a bed where the sun will be behind you.  Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Most grow as annuals in all zones. These perky yellow or orange flowers really light up a garden bed. The plant’s distinctive (should we say strong?) odor also keeps pests away. Marigolds are great as cut flowers, too. ‘Moonsong Deep Orange,’ a hybrid that has been named an All-America Selection winner, has frilly, densely packed flowers. But many other marigolds look more like daisies, with just a row or two of petals around a dark center.  Care: Requires full sun; regular water. Grows as an annual in all zones.

From roses to peonies, these are the blooms that are the most commonly requested by brides and grooms (and for good reason!). Photo by Nikki Daskalakis 
When it comes to wedding flowers, it can certainly be overwhelming (to say the least) to tell your florist exactly what you want. Besides the plethora of styles and color palettes, having to figure out what specific blooms you love and want to display on one of the most special days of your life—especially if you aren't a "flower person"—can be a real headache.
 
It gets more complicated: Once you've decided on one kind of flower you're drawn to, like a rose, you'll quickly find out that there are over 100 different types of roses. So what's a wedding flower novice to do? First of all, we'd like to congratulate you on taking the first step by admitting that you're new on the floral scene. You've come to the right place. Secondly, we're here to help—which is why we tapped several of the country's leading floral designers to break down the most popular types of wedding flowers.
 
Meet the Expert 
Before we dive into the list, it's important to understand flowers' seasonality; certain blooms are only available at specific types of the year, which is why keeping an open mind (and being open to substitutions) is important—for both your overall design scheme and your budget (out-of-season florals get expensive fast). "I still find opportunities to educate couples on flower seasonality," says Maxine Owens, a wedding floral designer based in Texas. "I'll get inspiration photos of spring flowers in the fall, and vice versa. I usually offer substitutions, like garden roses for peonies, while keeping the color palette and design intact. Using in-season florals is always best—for the price tag and the overall look."
 
Ahead, we've worked with our experts to compile a list of the most popular types of wedding flowers—and everything you need to know about including them in your big day.

This one is a no-brainer. We all know what a rose is! What you may not know is that there are more varieties of roses than you can shake a bouquet at. The larger, fluffier, and more multi-petaled kinds—like garden roses—make perfect face flowers (meaning, the showstoppers of a bouquet or centerpiece) and are ideal for when you don't want to use a peony. Smaller ones—like spray roses—add a delicate accent to bouquets and centerpieces. While most roses are in peak bloom from spring to fall, many are cultivated in greenhouses and available all year round. "They make a great design choice for guaranteed availability," says Owens.
 
As for their cost? "Standard roses are more affordable than garden roses, but are often more hearty and long stemmed, making them great for arches, tall centerpieces, and installations," Owens adds. She still thinks the lusher garden iterations are best for "more detailed work, like bouquets, centerpieces, and cake flowers," despite the price increase.

Hands down, this is the most highly coveted of all wedding flowers. "I think these will forever be a favorite of brides everywhere," affirms McNeff. Yes, their large faces and high petal counts make them romantic and feminine, but they're also one of the most expensive blooms out there—which is why McNeff recommends reserving them for special moments or large floral budgets. If you must have peonies, but you don't have a big budget, use them in your bouquet and at the head table (if you're having one) only.
 
These highly sought-after blooms have an extremely short spring season, and are often only available from April to June. They hold up well so long as they are fresh, says McNeff; older blooms will start to lose their petals quickly.
 
"Anemones aren't for everyone, but for those looking for a statement, this is certainly an easy one to gravitate towards," say Lauren Anderson and Rachel Bridgwood of Sweet Root Village. These graphic flowers are best for the modern bride, and usually come in black and white; they also come in some other varied styles (think green centers, red or purple petals, and more), they add.
 
The beauty of anemones is that they're amenable to working alone in a mono-fleur arrangement (the Sweet Root Village founders love using them en masse in centerpieces) or mixed in with other flowers as more of an accent. But beware: These wilt-sensitive beauties tend to be on the more delicate side, so if you're getting married out in the heat, make sure your florist water-picks the stems—and while they'll work in a bride's personal arrangement, skip them for boutonnières, say our experts. Colder months are prime time for these contemporary flowers, whose season extends from August to May.

Anthurium has become very popular for modern and nontraditional couples, explain Anderson and Bridgwood. "They are shiny, eye-catching, and offer bold, clean lines that enhance a variety of styles and designs," they say. They're available for most of the year and come in a variety of colors and sizes. "They don't love cold temperatures, but they are very hearty otherwise," the floral designers share. "They can be added to bouquets, focal installations, and centerpieces. They do beautifully mixed with other blooms, as well as featured all on their own."

One of our all-time fave blooms, dahlias are great face flowers because they have such a grand presence (dinner plate dahlias can be as large as your head) without packing the punch price-wise of a peony. Plus, they come in so many beautiful colors and a wide array of sizes, so there's a variety out there for every kind of wedding theme. Fall brides, rejoice! These stunners bloom from mid-summer through autumn.
 
They do have a few limitations, however. "As gorgeous as they are, they do not always ship well, so if there’s not a local source, finding hearty blooms can be challenging," says Owens, who says dahlias are her favorite flower on this list. "They also don’t do well in extreme heat, so high-temperature outdoor weddings beware." They can also be inconsistent in their durability, she explains. All in all, if you manage to have dahlia-centric wedding, you're very lucky, she says.

One of the sweetest smelling blooms, lilacs are drapey and romantic and can also work well on their own in a simple bouquet. Coming in shades of purple and white, lilacs are also quite delicate, so you have to be very careful to prevent wilting. Once it starts to go, there's pretty much no reviving it. Springtime weddings are optimal for these buds, which peak from April through June.

You've probably seen these little guys in 75 percent of the arrangements you have pinned on your flower Pinterest board. And for good reason: They're a professional darling. "Ranunculus continue to blow us away with their dainty perfection—and they add incredible transition tones between other flowers to really enhance a palette," say Bridgwood and Anderson.
 
They are usually used as accents and not as the stars of the show. Ruffly petals with wiggly stems, these are great for adding a little movement and wildness to your bouquet or centerpiece. They come in a huge spectrum of colors, but are all around the same size. These flowers prefer cooler temperatures, blooming from February through May.

There's nothing not sweet about sweet peas. Everything from their scent to their dainty stems and almost translucent petals is so special. They often come in variegated colors, which adds to their ethereal look and softness. "They are what florists call a line flower," says McNeff, explaining that the blossoms bloom along a line and offer structure.
 
These types of flowers are best when used in centerpieces or personal arrangements, adds McNeff. We love the idea of a simple, small bouquet of sweet peas held together by a loose silk ribbon. But, you may be surprised to hear that these sweeties don't relish warm temperatures. Their season extends from December to May.

Hydrangeas are mainly seen in classic blue or white, but we're really digging the sophisticated, chic older sister of the aforementioned classics—hydrangeas that are dusty and multi-colored, known as antique hydrangeas. Not only are they hardier (the diva-ish blue and white variety will die the moment they are even the slightest bit uncomfortable), but they're also so much more interesting. Plus, their blooming season aligns perfectly with the prime wedding months, flourishing from May through early fall.
 
As for some other varieties to consider? "We love working with styles like Oak Leaf, Peegee, Lacecap, and Limelight—especially because these styles often change color as the season changes and we get some stunning soft pink mauve tones," say Bridgwood and Anderson.
 
Like many of the other flowers we've listed, tulips are so much more than the generic variety you're probably picturing in your head. There are fringed tulips (that look just like they sound), double tulips (with twice as many petals than a normal tulip, making them much fuller), Rembrandt tulips (with beautiful red streaks running down their petals), and more. All varieties bloom from December to April. Plus, they aren't budget busters, which is always a pro.

Although beautiful as houseplants, orchids have long been synonymous with a kind of tackiness when used too aggressively as wedding flowers—à la so many early aughts wedding mistakes. Recently, however, there's been a resurgence of using orchids in much more interesting ways—especially in gorgeous sherbet and pastel shades and some dusty colors that are really quite stunning. Take a chance on this modern classic which is available all year round. Their tropical origins make them a perfect fit for any beach or island nuptials.

These darling buds have quite the regal repertoire. They were the flower of choice for both Kate Middleton's and Grace Kelly's royal wedding bouquets. With such an iconic history, it's surprising how much of a demure and inviting presence they have—making a serious case for statement-making simplicity.
 
Available in white and pink, these buds are only accessible during a short timeframe, from early to mid spring. "They can be very finicky and temperamental," say Bridgwood and Anderson. "It can also be an incredibly expensive flower per tiny, dainty stem, so expect a very high overall price even when looking at a petite bouquet."

Speaking of statement simplicity: Calla lilies are as luxe and dramatic as they are minimal. Think of them as the floral iteration of a chic art installation floating in the middle of a grand, but empty space. These poignant blooms look incredible in single-flower bouquets, but their long stems also lend themselves to a lot of artistic expression. While these sleek stunners may seem high maintenance, they can be sourced year round.

"I love hellebore for their beautiful, delicate faces in gorgeous antique tones," says Owens. The five-petal bloom can vary in color from white, pink, purple, and green—and can also help fill out and add some texture to your floral arrangements. As they are among the earliest to bloom each year, hellebore flowers are a great option for your winter or early spring wedding.

Protea flowers have become a popular option for weddings. The large, unique, and very dramatic blooms make for attention-grabbing arrangements. The striking king protea is hard to miss, with its large, pincushion-like center surrounded by colorful pointed petals. With dozens of variations in a multitude of colors, it should come as no surprise to see a protea make it into one of your flower arrangements or bouquets.

Carnations have been a beloved flower dating back 2,000 years, with records of them being used in Greek and Roman ceremonies. Though they fell out of favor several years ago, they're back in a big way—and that's partly in thanks to the development of more impressive varietals and colorways. "The varieties and colors and styles available have continued to expand and these blooms are thankfully seeing a huge resurgence," says Anderson and Bridgwood. "They don't have a place in every type of wedding, but they can absolutely elevate a design when used well."
 
You'll find these lush beauties, which are hearty in all conditions and easy to transport, year round. They're also one of the most cost-effective floral options for your big day.

Another breathtaking wedding flower, popular gardenias are those with the bright white petals and glossy evergreen leaves. Gardenias can be a bit fragile to transport and costlier than other flower options. Still, the clean look makes them a beautiful selection for your summer wedding. Gardenias also have a pleasant scent, so they can be an excellent choice for boutonnières and corsages.

From roses to peonies, these are the blooms that are the most commonly requested by brides and grooms (and for good reason!). Photo by Nikki Daskalakis 
When it comes to wedding flowers, it can certainly be overwhelming (to say the least) to tell your florist exactly what you want. Besides the plethora of styles and color palettes, having to figure out what specific blooms you love and want to display on one of the most special days of your life—especially if you aren&#x27;t a &quot;flower person&quot;—can be a real headache.
 
It gets more complicated: Once you&#x27;ve decided on one kind of flower you&#x27;re drawn to, like a rose, you&#x27;ll quickly find out that there are over 100 different types of roses. So what&#x27;s a wedding flower novice to do? First of all, we&#x27;d like to congratulate you on taking the first step by admitting that you&#x27;re new on the floral scene. You&#x27;ve come to the right place. Secondly, we&#x27;re here to help—which is why we tapped several of the country&#x27;s leading floral designers to break down the most popular types of wedding flowers.
 
Meet the Expert 
Before we dive into the list, it&#x27;s important to understand flowers&#x27; seasonality; certain blooms are only available at specific types of the year, which is why keeping an open mind (and being open to substitutions) is important—for both your overall design scheme and your budget (out-of-season florals get expensive fast). &quot;I still find opportunities to educate couples on flower seasonality,&quot; says Maxine Owens, a wedding floral designer based in Texas. &quot;I&#x27;ll get inspiration photos of spring flowers in the fall, and vice versa. I usually offer substitutions, like garden roses for peonies, while keeping the color palette and design intact. Using in-season florals is always best—for the price tag and the overall look.&quot;
 
Ahead, we&#x27;ve worked with our experts to compile a list of the most popular types of wedding flowers—and everything you need to know about including them in your big day.

This one is a no-brainer. We all know what a rose is! What you may not know is that there are more varieties of roses than you can shake a bouquet at. The larger, fluffier, and more multi-petaled kinds—like garden roses—make perfect face flowers (meaning, the showstoppers of a bouquet or centerpiece) and are ideal for when you don&#x27;t want to use a peony. Smaller ones—like spray roses—add a delicate accent to bouquets and centerpieces. While most roses are in peak bloom from spring to fall, many are cultivated in greenhouses and available all year round. &quot;They make a great design choice for guaranteed availability,&quot; says Owens.
 
As for their cost? &quot;Standard roses are more affordable than garden roses, but are often more hearty and long stemmed, making them great for arches, tall centerpieces, and installations,&quot; Owens adds. She still thinks the lusher garden iterations are best for &quot;more detailed work, like bouquets, centerpieces, and cake flowers,&quot; despite the price increase.

Hands down, this is the most highly coveted of all wedding flowers. &quot;I think these will forever be a favorite of brides everywhere,&quot; affirms McNeff. Yes, their large faces and high petal counts make them romantic and feminine, but they&#x27;re also one of the most expensive blooms out there—which is why McNeff recommends reserving them for special moments or large floral budgets. If you must have peonies, but you don&#x27;t have a big budget, use them in your bouquet and at the head table (if you&#x27;re having one) only.
 
These highly sought-after blooms have an extremely short spring season, and are often only available from April to June. They hold up well so long as they are fresh, says McNeff; older blooms will start to lose their petals quickly.
 
&quot;Anemones aren&#x27;t for everyone, but for those looking for a statement, this is certainly an easy one to gravitate towards,&quot; say Lauren Anderson and Rachel Bridgwood of Sweet Root Village. These graphic flowers are best for the modern bride, and usually come in black and white; they also come in some other varied styles (think green centers, red or purple petals, and more), they add.
 
The beauty of anemones is that they&#x27;re amenable to working alone in a mono-fleur arrangement (the Sweet Root Village founders love using them en masse in centerpieces) or mixed in with other flowers as more of an accent. But beware: These wilt-sensitive beauties tend to be on the more delicate side, so if you&#x27;re getting married out in the heat, make sure your florist water-picks the stems—and while they&#x27;ll work in a bride&#x27;s personal arrangement, skip them for boutonnières, say our experts. Colder months are prime time for these contemporary flowers, whose season extends from August to May.

Anthurium has become very popular for modern and nontraditional couples, explain Anderson and Bridgwood. &quot;They are shiny, eye-catching, and offer bold, clean lines that enhance a variety of styles and designs,&quot; they say. They&#x27;re available for most of the year and come in a variety of colors and sizes. &quot;They don&#x27;t love cold temperatures, but they are very hearty otherwise,&quot; the floral designers share. &quot;They can be added to bouquets, focal installations, and centerpieces. They do beautifully mixed with other blooms, as well as featured all on their own.&quot;

One of our all-time fave blooms, dahlias are great face flowers because they have such a grand presence (dinner plate dahlias can be as large as your head) without packing the punch price-wise of a peony. Plus, they come in so many beautiful colors and a wide array of sizes, so there&#x27;s a variety out there for every kind of wedding theme. Fall brides, rejoice! These stunners bloom from mid-summer through autumn.
 
They do have a few limitations, however. &quot;As gorgeous as they are, they do not always ship well, so if there’s not a local source, finding hearty blooms can be challenging,&quot; says Owens, who says dahlias are her favorite flower on this list. &quot;They also don’t do well in extreme heat, so high-temperature outdoor weddings beware.&quot; They can also be inconsistent in their durability, she explains. All in all, if you manage to have dahlia-centric wedding, you&#x27;re very lucky, she says.

One of the sweetest smelling blooms, lilacs are drapey and romantic and can also work well on their own in a simple bouquet. Coming in shades of purple and white, lilacs are also quite delicate, so you have to be very careful to prevent wilting. Once it starts to go, there&#x27;s pretty much no reviving it. Springtime weddings are optimal for these buds, which peak from April through June.

You&#x27;ve probably seen these little guys in 75 percent of the arrangements you have pinned on your flower Pinterest board. And for good reason: They&#x27;re a professional darling. &quot;Ranunculus continue to blow us away with their dainty perfection—and they add incredible transition tones between other flowers to really enhance a palette,&quot; say Bridgwood and Anderson.
 
They are usually used as accents and not as the stars of the show. Ruffly petals with wiggly stems, these are great for adding a little movement and wildness to your bouquet or centerpiece. They come in a huge spectrum of colors, but are all around the same size. These flowers prefer cooler temperatures, blooming from February through May.

There&#x27;s nothing not sweet about sweet peas. Everything from their scent to their dainty stems and almost translucent petals is so special. They often come in variegated colors, which adds to their ethereal look and softness. &quot;They are what florists call a line flower,&quot; says McNeff, explaining that the blossoms bloom along a line and offer structure.
 
These types of flowers are best when used in centerpieces or personal arrangements, adds McNeff. We love the idea of a simple, small bouquet of sweet peas held together by a loose silk ribbon. But, you may be surprised to hear that these sweeties don&#x27;t relish warm temperatures. Their season extends from December to May.

Hydrangeas are mainly seen in classic blue or white, but we&#x27;re really digging the sophisticated, chic older sister of the aforementioned classics—hydrangeas that are dusty and multi-colored, known as antique hydrangeas. Not only are they hardier (the diva-ish blue and white variety will die the moment they are even the slightest bit uncomfortable), but they&#x27;re also so much more interesting. Plus, their blooming season aligns perfectly with the prime wedding months, flourishing from May through early fall.
 
As for some other varieties to consider? &quot;We love working with styles like Oak Leaf, Peegee, Lacecap, and Limelight—especially because these styles often change color as the season changes and we get some stunning soft pink mauve tones,&quot; say Bridgwood and Anderson.
 
Like many of the other flowers we&#x27;ve listed, tulips are so much more than the generic variety you&#x27;re probably picturing in your head. There are fringed tulips (that look just like they sound), double tulips (with twice as many petals than a normal tulip, making them much fuller), Rembrandt tulips (with beautiful red streaks running down their petals), and more. All varieties bloom from December to April. Plus, they aren&#x27;t budget busters, which is always a pro.

Although beautiful as houseplants, orchids have long been synonymous with a kind of tackiness when used too aggressively as wedding flowers—à la so many early aughts wedding mistakes. Recently, however, there&#x27;s been a resurgence of using orchids in much more interesting ways—especially in gorgeous sherbet and pastel shades and some dusty colors that are really quite stunning. Take a chance on this modern classic which is available all year round. Their tropical origins make them a perfect fit for any beach or island nuptials.

These darling buds have quite the regal repertoire. They were the flower of choice for both Kate Middleton&#x27;s and Grace Kelly&#x27;s royal wedding bouquets. With such an iconic history, it&#x27;s surprising how much of a demure and inviting presence they have—making a serious case for statement-making simplicity.
 
Available in white and pink, these buds are only accessible during a short timeframe, from early to mid spring. &quot;They can be very finicky and temperamental,&quot; say Bridgwood and Anderson. &quot;It can also be an incredibly expensive flower per tiny, dainty stem, so expect a very high overall price even when looking at a petite bouquet.&quot;

Speaking of statement simplicity: Calla lilies are as luxe and dramatic as they are minimal. Think of them as the floral iteration of a chic art installation floating in the middle of a grand, but empty space. These poignant blooms look incredible in single-flower bouquets, but their long stems also lend themselves to a lot of artistic expression. While these sleek stunners may seem high maintenance, they can be sourced year round.

&quot;I love hellebore for their beautiful, delicate faces in gorgeous antique tones,&quot; says Owens. The five-petal bloom can vary in color from white, pink, purple, and green—and can also help fill out and add some texture to your floral arrangements.

Plant calibrachoa in a hanging basket to show off its spreading shape, or use it as a filler or spiller in a large mixed container. As a bonus, there’s no need to deadhead these garden glories; they’ll thrive with full sun, moist soil, and monthly fertilization. Available at Burpee.com; $19.99 for 3 plants.

 In areas with mild winters, lantana grows into a large shrub, but most gardeners treat it as an annual instead. The plant blooms brilliantly from late spring through early autumn, with tiny individual blossoms clustering into “bouquets” of yellow, pink, red, and orange. Lantana loves heat and direct sun, resists drought fairly well, isn’t bothered by many insects, and doesn’t need much fertilizer. Available at Burpee.com; $19.99 for 3 plants.

 A short-lived perennial, gaillardia (also known as blanket flower) loves the summer heat. Butterflies often visit its daisy-shaped flowers, which are bi- or tricolored in shades of gold, orange, burgundy, and yellow. Since gaillardia ranges from dwarf to three feet high, it’s a great choice for a large container—although it will thrive in any patch of well-drained, slightly sandy soil that receives full sun. Expect the drought-resistant plant to bloom from late spring through fall. Available at Burpee.com; $12.99.

 Another tender perennial treated as an annual, coreopsis (which goes by the common name of tickseed) blooms with solid pink, orange, yellow, or burgundy-and-yellow blossoms. Coreopsis generally grows in a clump, sending up a seemingly endless parade of flowers on long stems. Butterflies and other pollinators love them, and birds enjoy snacking on their seeds. Make sure to give coreopsis full sun, well-draining soil, and regular watering when first planted. Available on Burpee.com; $13.99. Related: 11 Ways to Buy Your Garden on the Internet

 Gazania opens in the sunshine and closes at nighttime or on cloudy days. The daisy-like petals come in a riot of bright colors, including yellow, orange, red, pink, burgundy, and white. Many varieties have eyes or stripes as well. Gazania grows in low mounds of spreading clumps, and it looks equally stunning in the ground or in a container with well-draining soil. These beauties like it hot and sunny; in the shade, the flowers won’t open. Available on Amazon; $6.49 for 100 seeds. Related: 10 Secret Ingredients to Make Your Garden Grow

 It’s hard to imagine a summer garden without at least a few petunias. You’ll find petunias in nearly every color except true blue, and petals can be solid, bicolor, striped, eyed, or ruffled. Plant your petunias in a sunny spot with minimal wind and well-drained soil, don’t let them become overly dry, and fertilize monthly. Also, watch out for pests and disease; petunias are prone to mildew and bacterial rot, and they're subject to damage from caterpillars, aphids, and leaf miners.

 The stiff, pom-pom shaped flowers of globe amaranth look glorious in any garden. While most varieties are magenta, you’ll also find cultivars in pink, white, purple, and red. One of the best things about globe amaranth is its versatility; the tall and spiky plant looks great in a container, but it will also thrive in a flower bed or cottage garden. Globe amaranth prefers full sun, doesn’t require much fertilizer, and withstands most plant diseases and insects. Available on Amazon; $6.49 for 1000 seeds.

 Cosmos may look fragile, but it's actually a hardy flower that blooms throughout the spring and summer. The most common variety, Cosmos bipinatus, can surpass two feet in height, with dancing flowers on thin stems stretching above the ferny foliage. While pink and white are the most common colors, you’ll also find blossoms in red, yellow, orange, and burgundy. Cosmos prefers full sun (with some afternoon shade in hot climates) as well as slightly dry soil that’s not too fertile. Available at Burpee.com; $3.99 for 50 seeds.

 While each individual flower of baby's breath euphorbia is very small, the blooms cluster together to create the appearance of a fluffy cloud from a distance. Baby’s breath euphorbia looks equally gorgeous in a container or as an airy touch to a sunny garden bed, where it will bloom continuously until the first frost. As a bonus, this annual doesn’t require fertilizer or excessive water, and you won’t need to deadhead it. Available at The Home Depot; $34.95 for a pack of four plants.

 The salvia family is very large indeed, but it’s the annual Salvia splendens that blooms most continuously from late spring until fall. You’ll find many named cultivars of this variety of salvia, which sends up sprigs of tubular purple, red, or white blossoms that draw hummingbirds like a magnet. Salvia often reaches two or more feet in height and prefers full sun. The pretty flowers grow best in containers, but they also do well massed in a flower bed or lining a garden path.

 One of the hardest-working annuals in your summer garden is the zinnia, which has a stiff and upright growth pattern. These colorful plants like heat, full sun, and moderate moisture levels. On the downside, zinnia attracts mildew and rust; in fact, it can seem nearly impossible to prevent these annoying fungal diseases from spreading on your plants, but they won’t stop the flowers from growing.

 Annual vinca (Catharanthus roseus) may not come in a wide range of colors—mostly hot pink, light pink, white, and lilac— but you’d be hard-pressed to find a better flower for lining pathways, filling containers, or enhancing your flower beds. While there are trailing varieties of annual vinca, most are short, mounding plants with glossy green foliage. Vinca grow best with full sun, a hot climate, monthly fertilizing, and limited water.

 The shady spots in your yard need love too. Spruce up the dimly lit spaces with impatiens, which  pump out white, pink, fuchsia, lilac, red, and coral flowers from spring until the first frost. Impatiens thrive in shady spots with moist soil, but as a downside, they can be quickly wiped out by downy mildew. Available at The Home Depot; $34.99 for a pack of four plants.

 Do you need a trailing plant to edge your containers or hang over a window box? How about a small-scale ground cover for a rock garden, fairy garden, or gaps in a stone wall? Then you’ll love moss rose, a low-growing succulent that covers itself with papery blooms resembling roses. The flowers, which close at night and open with the sun, come mostly in bright shades of pink, red, orange, yellow, cream, and white. A fairly drought-resistant plant, moss rose needs full sun and well-draining soil. Available at Burpee.com; $4.99. Related: The Best Places to Buy Plants Online
