Joining a study group allows you to collaborate with classmates, share knowledge, and discuss difficult topics. Explaining concepts to others can also enhance your own understanding. Additionally, studying in a group can provide motivation and support, making the learning process more enjoyable. If you’re struggling with a challenging subject, don’t hesitate to seek extra help. Many schools offer tutoring services or have teachers available for additional support. Taking advantage of these resources can make a significant difference in your understanding of the subject. Additionally, online resources, such as educational websites and video tutorials, can provide additional explanations and practice materials. Regular practice is key to mastering any subject, especially challenging ones. Set aside dedicated time each day to review and practice what you’ve learned. This could involve solving problems, completing practice exercises, or revisiting difficult concepts. Consistent practice not only reinforces your understanding but also helps you identify areas where you may need further improvement. Lastly, it’s important to remember that mastering challenging subjects takes time and effort. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t understand something right away. Keep a positive mindset, stay motivated, and persevere. Remember that even the most difficult subjects can be conquered with dedication and persistence. Believe in yourself and don’t give up! In summary, advanced math and science courses are most frequently cited as the hardest subjects due to their abstract concepts, problem-solving requirements, and vast amounts of information to learn. Literature, foreign language, and accelerated classes also pose significant challenges for many students. No matter the subject, adopting strong study habits, utilizing available resources, and persisting through difficulties can help you succeed. While some subjects may come more easily than others, putting in the time and effort to truly master any challenging material is worthwhile. Developing these academic skills will serve you well in future endeavors, so don’t become discouraged. With the right strategies and support, even the most difficult subjects can be conquered.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: Although the learning process has been a hot topic of various sciences, including neuroscience, psychology, pedagogy and the learning theory, the truth is that humankind has yet to discover the full array of factors involved. For the time being, learning is defined as a process that implies constantly altering the existing skills, behaviors and information by synthesizing and acquiring new types of information. Simple as it may sound, it is necessary to mention that people know only a low percentage of the info and about the facts present in the world and most of the knowledge is attained via the subjects we study. And, as you probably know or remember from school, some subjects are more difficult to comprehend than others. Following is a list of the hardest subjects to understand.   1. Quantum physics  The first attempts to understand physical phenomenon at a microscopic scale can be traced back to the 17th century to Christian Huygens and his inquiry on the wave nature of light. However, it wasn’t until the 20th century that quantum physics was defined by Albert Einstein. An advanced branch of physics, the quantum theory tries to understand reality at a microscopic scale, making it confusing and puzzling overall. In fact, the high level of mathematics and physics involved in comprehending this science can even confuse modern scientists who employ it in the finest real time applications.   2. Thermodynamics  If you are curious about the motion of substances on our planet, then you should look no further than thermodynamics, the subjects that explains the rules and implications of heat transfer. Even though thermodynamics is based on three basic rules and their applications, which on a side note most students understand relatively quickly, the other topics such as the elemental properties of materials, cycles and particularly the entropy related topics are not very simple.   3. Rocket science  Even though it is generically dubbed rocket science, the subject integrates a plethora of concepts from other fields of study. In fact, it is impossible to study or understand the basic notions in this field without a solid knowledge of mathematics and physics. In addition, let’s not forget that you need to fully comprehend aerospace, travelling in outer space, fuel chemistry and many other without being able to put your knowledge into practice. This is perhaps why you should expect a considerably higher rate of failure than success if you want to study and understand this subject.   4. Electromagnetic field theory  Granted, you won’t come across or have to be tested on your knowledge in electromagnetic field theory unless you decide to take electronics 101 in college. Even in the situation where the subject is taught to knowledgeable students, true comprehension still requires the ability to imagine things in 3D, not to mention the plethora of proof that validates Maxwell’s equations.   5. Anatomy  Anatomy or studying the parts of the human body in detail can be classified as one of the most interesting subjects you can actually learn, unless of course you are a medicine student. While for the vast majority of people anatomy implies simply knowing some general aspects regarding the human body, for future physicians and medical specialists the subject is all about memorizing a lot of data regarding every single bone, muscle and nerve as well as their branches and divisions.   6. Equity and trust  While medicine students have to go to great lengths to learn anatomy, law students will need to successfully pass their equity and trust exam in order to be able to practice. It is necessary to mention that while the subject is perceived as very difficult for students due to the constant fluctuations in international commercial practices, attorneys state that this is nothing more than a technical issue. Furthermore, despite its difficulty and the number of complicated cases that aspiring lawyers need to study, the equity and trust class is important for developing a unique way of thinking.   7. Psychology  Despite the fact that psychology students claim the only truly difficult subject in college is statistics, it is necessary to point out that the field of psychology is tricky and awkward overall. Without denying the fact that psychology rests on a few solid theories about human interaction, mental development and mental organization, it is also true that these theories are mostly indicators that show you where to start. In practice, you need to be open-minded and constantly remember that people are very different and you need to adapt to each and every one of them.   8. Accounting  An important subject for economy students, it is necessary to mention that basic accounting is a necessity for everyone who plans to successfully run a business. In addition, given the current global economic situation, certain topics from accounting such as the cash flow analysis or the best legal methods to use in order to make significant savings for example could prove to be invaluable knowledge and may even get you out of bankruptcy. In spite of its paramount importance, accounting is still one of the most conceptually difficult subjects to understand.   9. Mathematics  In all fairness, with very few exceptions the students’ greatest fear during school years is mathematics. In spite of the fact that the child has studied the subject extensively over the years, during an exam the simple sight of the topic is enough to cast a shadow of doubt as to whether they can correctly solve the problem or not on their minds on. While dreaded, let’s not forget that math is mandatory for practicing any modern science these days.   10. Neuroscience  Once a simple branch of biology, neuroscience has evolved into an interdisciplinary science that requires medium to advanced knowledge of engineering, mathematics, chemistry, physics, computer science, linguistic, medicine, philosophy and psychology. Neuroscience deals with the scientific study of the nervous system in all his aspects, from its basic structure to how it can be modified. Because technology is rapidly evolving these days to permit a better imaging of the brain, so is our understanding of the nervous system.  difficultsubjectsTop 10 Listtop ten list My guess is that the list is 10 subjects that you have trouble understanding. I have trouble understanding why weeds seem to grow better than grass. Your no. 9 is a broad statement as during my years in school I never met anyone who feared math. Admittedly some didn’t like it that much but certainly had no fear of it. Computer programming isn’t on this list? Computer Programming should be on the list. computer programming is based on logical connections and assumptions created by human, whereas all the others are not artificially created thus easier to comprehend (just a guess) Human intelligence is limited.  Things created by God are much more complicated than things created by humans. bit odd that accounting was higher on the list than neuroscience I think computer programming and it’s algorithms should be included into this list Computer programming is not a science.  It is just a series of codes that computers can understand.  I heard that Facebook has their own computer programming language that sounds like broken English that computer programmers can understand.  Some computer languages may sound like broken Russian, French, etc., just depends on who makes it. power electronics I would say the science of 5th dimension physics. nothing is difficult in this world everything is easy for a human brain if you just trust on your self and get more and more interest in these topics. Do not forget, many people cannot analyze!  They even lack common sense! however Einsteins theory of relativity is also difficult for most people to understand because it contain logic’s and solid pure mathematics. Anatomy should not be on the list of difficult subjects.  It is just straight memorization that anyone can do. I think philosphy   should be one of the subjects because the one question that remains at last is about the exiexistenof god.. PhiloPhiloscan solve that alot matthew is married to daniel and franny. They were born with intersex in the left testes. Daniel likes men and matt is a AFAB.

As competition in every field increases day by day, selection processes become tougher and more focused. The screening categories are stringent and with the current boom in population, the number of competitors has risen while the opportunities are on a downward spiral. Each course is unique and designed to groom students to be the best versions of themselves in the competitive world. Amongst all these, there are a few programs that are considered the toughest courses in the world in terms of subjects, assignments, duration, and examination. Most of the time, it is also true that the toughest courses in the world are also the ones that hold the toughest examinations, whether internally or in the form of an entrance test. Through this blog, we will give you a quick tour of the toughest courses and exams in the world. Let’s begin! It is a dream of students to pursue a course that can help in shaping a great career. Most of the time it doesn’t come easy to candidates. In order to be successful, students have to go through a rigorous and challenging curriculum to get lucrative salaries later. Given below is the list of toughest courses in the world that can boost your career: Wondering about the toughest course in the world as per Guinness 2018? It is believed that a Bachelor of Science in Nursing or BSN is the toughest course in the world as per the Guinness Book of World Records along with courses like MBBS, BCom, IAS, IPS and Engineering, etc.  But, Guinness World Records has clarified that there is no such toughest or most difficult course as they are not objectively measurable! Also Read: Best Engineering Courses India is home to a number of excellent universities which offer a range of different courses in all fields of study. Just like these courses are known to have a difficult curriculum across the world, there are some courses considered the most difficult ones by Indian students.

Here is a list of some of the toughest degrees in the world: Do you know what the hardest courses are at Harvard University?Mechanics and Special Relativity, Microeconomic Theory, Organic Chemistry, Honors Abstract Algebra, Engineering Thermodynamics and Social Studies are considered to be the hardest courses at Harvard! Engineering is undoubtedly one of the toughest courses in the world. But have you wondered which of the different specialisations within engineering are considered the toughest? Let’s take a look at this list to know about the toughest engineering courses: In the contemporary world, students have to undergo tough competitive exams in order to pursue higher education or get a job. Listed below are the toughest exams in the world: Fact – Which exam is most difficult in India? Amongst all the competitive exams in India, UPSC Civil Services Exam is considered to be the toughest one, followed by the Chartered Accountancy examination. Also Read: Top Medical Courses Considered one of the toughest courses in the world, engineering students are required to have tactical skills, analytical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. For a student, a background in Science is crucial for a future in engineering and this begins by selecting the Science stream during the 11th-12th standard. From there, all the way to university entrance examinations, every step of an engineer is tough. Although you can rest assured that opportunities for further studies and job offers are good for engineers and probably why our elders keep pushing us toward it.  Further, applying for Engineering courses abroad, you will have to provide your GRE results and scores and for Engineering management programs, foreign universities might ask you to provide either GMAT or GRE scores. The Chartered Accountancy course is also featured on this list because it is amongst the toughest courses in the world. Even though this course is a safe career path with well-paying opportunities, there is no denying how demanding it is or how much hard work it takes to complete it. From matching balance sheets to making sure that the accounts notebook is error-free, the life of a chartered account really is a tough one.  The Medical Science courses find themselves quite aptly on a list of the toughest courses in the world. To begin with the course, Indian students have to make sure that they appear for the NEET examination. While this course takes an exceptionally long time, the entire period is spent learning rather than memorizing the toughest textbooks, definitions, and diagrams. Mind you, there is nothing a medical student can skip because everything they learn is of the utmost importance. Here are a few blogs that will help you in understanding the intricacies of pursuing a career in Medicine:  While medicine and pharmacy walk the same line in terms of industry, both are quite different. Think of them as two sides of the same coin. Pharmacy is featured on the list of toughest courses in the world because of the structure and hard work it requires. Just like the other courses on this list, career prospects for this course have a wide scope and are always available. Whether it be a Bachelor of Pharmacy, Diploma in Pharmacy, or PhD in Pharmacy students, they all have to deal with Chemistry and Biology as a whole and this can be quite daunting to some. Furthermore, they also study aspects of Ayurveda, Physiology, Drug Formulation, Human Anatomy, and more. Grabbing a spot on the list of the toughest programs in the world, pursuing architecture courses is not as simple as it sounds. Contrary to popular assumption, it does not deal with interiors and exteriors alone; it also deals with the environment and its composition. Making use of sustainable, biodegradable materials and processes needs the sharpest and the most considerate of minds. One of the trends you’ll find here is that each of the toughest courses in the world provides ample job opportunities and the potential for a lot of growth. With more colleges dedicated solely to architecture, this course is developing a fresh perspective in the minds of the younger generation and helping them literally build our future. The last one to be named on the list of the toughest courses in the world, Law has more challenges than meets the eye. A career in law requires patience, an understanding of ethics, high perception skills, and a strong sense of individuality among other things. While there are no scientific equations or mathematical problems to solve in this course, students need to sharpen their memory and be on their toes at all times. Apart from humanities students, this field is among the popular career options in commerce without maths.  A prominent humanities subject that also intersects with medical science, Psychology is also considered among the toughest courses in the world. Being a scientific investigation and study of the human mind, Psychology is an umbrella discipline where students get to explore human behaviour in terms of varied contexts, such as individual, social, psychological, and industrial, amongst others. Every single person experiences a different emotion every single day which makes it tough to comprehend a human’s mind. Psychologists basically study human beings across different environments such the employees, criminals, students, children, people with disorders, and every other group of people. A career in Psychology requires you to be an excellent observer and communicator along with an investigative streak and attention to detail!

I didn’t have any expectations concerning that title, but the more I was astonished. Philippine Bar Exam Chemistry For those living in the U.S. of course this list is laughable, and the order of rigor is absolutely ridiculous.. A journalism degree is considerably easier than registered nursing and finance and practically any college degree of respectable rigor.  Foreign language at the bottom?  Learn Arabic or Icelandic after taking a Fine Arts major and then blog about it after learning several languages well enough to be an interpreter.  Most Law and Psychology majors wouldn’t stand a chance of getting a degree in Quantum Mechanics / Physics.  Young people looking at possible careers should be well warned about sites, blogs, and posts that post data without explaining what country the data relates to, and the methodology associated with what’s purported to be true.

The screening categories are stringent and with the current boom in population, the number of competitors has risen while the opportunities are on a downward spiral. Each course is unique and designed to groom students to be the best versions of themselves in the competitive world. Amongst all these, there are a few programs that are considered the toughest courses in the world in terms of subjects, assignments, duration, and examination. Most of the time, it is also true that the toughest courses in the world are also the ones that hold the toughest examinations, whether internally or in the form of an entrance test. Through this blog, we will give you a quick tour of the toughest courses and exams in the world. Let’s begin! It is a dream of students to pursue a course that can help in shaping a great career. Most of the time it doesn’t come easy to candidates. In order to be successful, students have to go through a rigorous and challenging curriculum to get lucrative salaries later. Given below is the list of toughest courses in the world that can boost your career: Wondering about the toughest course in the world as per Guinness 2018? It is believed that a Bachelor of Science in Nursing or BSN is the toughest course in the world as per the Guinness Book of World Records along with courses like MBBS, BCom, IAS, IPS and Engineering, etc.  But, Guinness World Records has clarified that there is no such toughest or most difficult course as they are not objectively measurable! Also Read: Best Engineering Courses India is home to a number of excellent universities which offer a range of different courses in all fields of study. Just like these courses are known to have a difficult curriculum across the world, there are some courses considered the most difficult ones by Indian students.

Here are some of them: There is a wide range of professional courses that students can pursue in Indian universities which come with a plethora of lucrative job opportunities. Here are some of the toughest professional courses in India that you can pursue: Also Read: CA Course Different degrees offered by universities around the world are considered tough based on factors including their duration, syllabus, and academic requirements. Here is a list of some of the toughest degrees in the world: Do you know what the hardest courses are at Harvard University?Mechanics and Special Relativity, Microeconomic Theory, Organic Chemistry, Honors Abstract Algebra, Engineering Thermodynamics and Social Studies are considered to be the hardest courses at Harvard! Engineering is undoubtedly one of the toughest courses in the world. But have you wondered which of the different specialisations within engineering are considered the toughest? Let’s take a look at this list to know about the toughest engineering courses: In the contemporary world, students have to undergo tough competitive exams in order to pursue higher education or get a job. Listed below are the toughest exams in the world: Fact – Which exam is most difficult in India? Amongst all the competitive exams in India, UPSC Civil Services Exam is considered to be the toughest one, followed by the Chartered Accountancy examination. Also Read: Top Medical Courses Considered one of the toughest courses in the world, engineering students are required to have tactical skills, analytical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. For a student, a background in Science is crucial for a future in engineering and this begins by selecting the Science stream during the 11th-12th standard. From there, all the way to university entrance examinations, every step of an engineer is tough. Although you can rest assured that opportunities for further studies and job offers are good for engineers and probably why our elders keep pushing us toward it.  Further, applying for Engineering courses abroad, you will have to provide your GRE results and scores and for Engineering management programs, foreign universities might ask you to provide either GMAT or GRE scores. The Chartered Accountancy course is also featured on this list because it is amongst the toughest courses in the world. Even though this course is a safe career path with well-paying opportunities, there is no denying how demanding it is or how much hard work it takes to complete it. From matching balance sheets to making sure that the accounts notebook is error-free, the life of a chartered account really is a tough one.  The Medical Science courses find themselves quite aptly on a list of the toughest courses in the world. To begin with the course, Indian students have to make sure that they appear for the NEET examination. While this course takes an exceptionally long time, the entire period is spent learning rather than memorizing the toughest textbooks, definitions, and diagrams. Mind you, there is nothing a medical student can skip because everything they learn is of the utmost importance. Here are a few blogs that will help you in understanding the intricacies of pursuing a career in Medicine:  While medicine and pharmacy walk the same line in terms of industry, both are quite different. Think of them as two sides of the same coin. Pharmacy is featured on the list of toughest courses in the world because of the structure and hard work it requires. Just like the other courses on this list, career prospects for this course have a wide scope and are always available. Whether it be a Bachelor of Pharmacy, Diploma in Pharmacy, or PhD in Pharmacy students, they all have to deal with Chemistry and Biology as a whole and this can be quite daunting to some. Furthermore, they also study aspects of Ayurveda, Physiology, Drug Formulation, Human Anatomy, and more. Grabbing a spot on the list of the toughest programs in the world, pursuing architecture courses is not as simple as it sounds. Contrary to popular assumption, it does not deal with interiors and exteriors alone; it also deals with the environment and its composition. Making use of sustainable, biodegradable materials and processes needs the sharpest and the most considerate of minds. One of the trends you’ll find here is that each of the toughest courses in the world provides ample job opportunities and the potential for a lot of growth. With more colleges dedicated solely to architecture, this course is developing a fresh perspective in the minds of the younger generation and helping them literally build our future. The last one to be named on the list of the toughest courses in the world, Law has more challenges than meets the eye. A career in law requires patience, an understanding of ethics, high perception skills, and a strong sense of individuality among other things. While there are no scientific equations or mathematical problems to solve in this course, students need to sharpen their memory and be on their toes at all times. Apart from humanities students, this field is among the popular career options in commerce without maths.  A prominent humanities subject that also intersects with medical science, Psychology is also considered among the toughest courses in the world. Being a scientific investigation and study of the human mind, Psychology is an umbrella discipline where students get to explore human behaviour in terms of varied contexts, such as individual, social, psychological, and industrial, amongst others. Every single person experiences a different emotion every single day which makes it tough to comprehend a human’s mind. Psychologists basically study human beings across different environments such the employees, criminals, students, children, people with disorders, and every other group of people. A career in Psychology requires you to be an excellent observer and communicator along with an investigative streak and attention to detail! You can explore a plethora of courses in this field across wide-ranging branches of psychology such as: Aeronautics is a branch of engineering which studies the working and the mechanisms of an aircraft and spacecraft.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: Medicine, mathematics, physics — you may have heard from friends and family that these are the hardest degrees in the world. But a deeper look into each degree often reveals that they may not be the hardest degrees in the world. Medicine is deemed challenging because it deals with people’s lives. What if, however, you’re someone who is passionate about helping children?  Completing a decades-long journey to become a pediatrician will no doubt still be hard, but not be the hardest thing for you. Maths is often seen as tough as well, as many people aren’t good with numbers. Now, imagine you are good with numbers and bad with words. A maths degree will be easier for you than a bachelor’s degree in English Literature that requires you to read 10 books in a week and write five essays. The point is how hard a degree is will differ from one person to another. And there is no one answer to the question “What are the hardest degrees in the world?” Instead, there are several answers, using various measures. And one of the most popular is how much a degree requires one to have a high IQ. Does having a higher IQ make you smarter? One professor of human development and applied psychology at the University of Toronto thinks otherwise. Source: Sean Rayford/ Getty Images North America/Getty Images/AFP IQ, short for intelligence quotient, evaluates a person’s reasoning ability. It assesses your capacity to apply logic and process information to arrive at conclusions or predictions.  Does having a high IQ make you more capable to pursue the hardest degrees in the world? Keith Stanovich, professor of human development and applied psychology at the University of Toronto, argues that IQ tests are great at measuring certain mental faculties like logic, abstract reasoning, and learning ability.  But these tests fall short when measuring abilities essential to making sound judgements in real-life situations.  They fail to assess things like a person’s ability to think critically or whether a person can override their intuitive cognitive biases.   For students, having a higher IQ doesn’t necessarily mean they might be able to ace some of the most challenging courses. What’s more, there’s no definitive answer as to what qualifies as the hardest degree in the world.  The Guinness Book of World Records, for example, does not provide a record of awarding the “hardest degree in the world”.  The reason? Guinness records are based on objective assessments, following criteria such as measurable, breakable, standardisable, and more.  Since everyone learns differently at various paces, it’s hard to pinpoint the hardest degree in the world.  There are, however, some factors that can help us to pinpoint some of the hardest degrees in the world.  We will look at two factors:  Just because the course you’re interested is one of the hardest in the world, it doesn’t mean you should put off your dreams of studying your favourite subject. Source: Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images North America/ Getty Images/AFP In these courses, you will build your knowledge of various mathematics principles, including calculus, trigonometry and algebra — skills needed to become an aerospace engineer.  To study aerospace engineering at the  undergraduate level, the University of Bristol requires you to get A*AA or A*A (in any order) in Mathematics and any one of Physics, Chemistry, Further Mathematics or Computer Science for your A Levels examinations.  Biomedical engineering requires the analytical problem-solving skills of engineering to develop innovative technology and equipment that enhance human health. Think pacemakers, insulin pumps, and printed organs. These are highly complex tools and machinery that must work precisely at all times — and are literally matters of life and death. It’s no surprise then that this is a programme that will require to master several subjects. These include biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, mathematics, and medical science. You are not expected to be experts at all of these but at the very least, you are required to be well-versed in two challenging fields of study. Most law graduates would go on to pursue a Bar exam if they want to become a practising lawyer, which can take up to at least four years. Source: Roslan Rahman/AFP Speak to any of  your friends who are studying law, and they might share with you a common complaint: there’s too much to read.  From constitutional law to criminal law, it can be a steep learning curve for law students to grasp various legal principles that touch many aspects of our daily lives — especially if you’re not used to reading in what is usually highly complex English sentences. That’s not the scariest part.  To become a lawyer, you would need to pass the Bar exams in the jurisdiction of the country you want to practice. In some countries, the passing rate can be incredibly slim. A Malaysian news outlet reported that less than 20% of students passed the Certificate in Legal Practice, a professional exam applicable to Malaysian law graduates with a degree from a foreign uni.  Like law, students who pursue accounting would need to take on additional training to become chartered accountants. Usually, it takes three years to complete a degree in accounting, followed by up to three more years of training. Sometimes, students do a longer degree accredited by the relevant  professional bodies. What’s more, you would need to be well-versed in mathematics, computer science, business management, and economics if you decide to study accounting. Don’t forget about tax regulations concerning individuals and businesses too, as they will be an integral part of your programme and later, career. As an architect, you often have to deal with elements that are outside your control, such as bad weather. Source: Iudovic Marin/AFP Architecture is more than sketching elaborate design plans.  To become an architect, you’ll need a good understanding of maths, geometry, trigonometry and algebra to plan the dimensions. What makes the course tough? The substantial workload. As a result, sleep deprivation is common among those who are studying architecture.  “Some professors say that, as an architecture student, all-nighters should be common practice,” said one Instagram user Rafay Qazi, who shared that one professor told them that “sleep is for the weak.” Ben Sweeting, an architecture course leader at Brighton University, shares: “It’s hard to do very well [at Architecture] and hard to pass. There are no perfect designs or ways of working, but wrong ways of working.  Sweeting adds: “It can also feel more personally challenging than other arts subjects, as your creative vision has to work in practice.” Let’s start with the course itself. You need to grasp the complex science behind various medicines, drugs, and diseases. Through clinical practice, you’ll learn how to interact with patients appropriately. The time it takes to become a doctor depends on where you are studying. But most countries require many, many years of training. In the US, you will first attend a four-year undergraduate programme. Later, you’ll attend medical school for four years and get matched to a residency upon graduation. Depending on your speciality, you will spend around three to seven years as a resident before taking a licensing exam for the state or province where you want to practise medicine. As a nursing student, you need to have good background knowledge, the ability to recall things quickly, and confidently identify health problems on your own. Source: Frederic J. Brown/AFP A nursing degree requires you to master both the practical skills of nursing and extensive background knowledge. To succeed, you need to grasp the global context of environmental determinants of health, have a basic understanding of bioscience and apply it to nursing. The tough part of this course is learning to work well with people — many of them. From interacting with patients to collaborative work with colleagues across multiple disciplines, you’re constantly on your feet. Practical study for aspiring nurses will expose student to plenty of blood, pain and suffering. This is never easy, sometimes even for the most experienced nurses. A dentistry degree teaches you all about preventing, detecting, and treating oral diseases.  In this, you can expect to learn about the theories behind dentistry, such as anatomy, physiology, microbiology, human disease, pathology and epidemiology.  There’s also the chance to gain practical experience of orthodontics, sedation and minor oral surgeries. As it is a relatively small organ, you need to be extremely precise — or risk causing pain to your patient. Due to this technical nature, there is only a handful of universities worldwide for you to pursue dentistry with excellence.  King’s College London, for instance, is one of the best dental schools in the UK. It ranked ninth in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2023 for dentistry.  The entry requirements to study dentistry here would be to achieve a grade A in Biology or Chemistry and a grade A in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics or Psychology. How do you actually study the human mind? That’s what you would be doing when pursuing psychology at an undergraduate level. Source: David Becker/Getty Images North America/Getty Images/AFP If you thought studying the human mind was easy, think again. This degree trains you to be skilled and interested in both scientific and social aspects of psychology, including biology and evolution, social anthropology, politics, philosophy, and sociology. While this degree is flexible, you must know how to apply it in an appropriate situation. Some graduates have managed to link psychology with human resources.  What makes psychology one of the hardest degrees in the world is how little we still know about the human mind. Unlike medicine, you can’t just amputate a gangrenous foot or let broken bones heal. Yet, so many people want to have good mental health. There is great demand for good mental well-being, but you will have limited resources and tools to help your patients. With the rise of chatbots like ChatGPT, unis have started to offer courses related to artificial intelligence. Here, you’ll learn how to design, build, and apply AI systems to your chosen areas of specialisation. To do this, a sound understanding of neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and mathematics will help you in your academic journey of uncovering the full potential of AI applications. A key reason this is considered one of the hardest degrees in the world is because we still know so little about what makes us human. What separates humans from animals? Why are there tasks that robots just can’t do? These are big questions that AI tries to answer.

To succeed, you need to grasp the global context of environmental determinants of health, have a basic understanding of bioscience and apply it to nursing. The tough part of this course is learning to work well with people — many of them. From interacting with patients to collaborative work with colleagues across multiple disciplines, you’re constantly on your feet. Practical study for aspiring nurses will expose student to plenty of blood, pain and suffering. This is never easy, sometimes even for the most experienced nurses. A dentistry degree teaches you all about preventing, detecting, and treating oral diseases.  In this, you can expect to learn about the theories behind dentistry, such as anatomy, physiology, microbiology, human disease, pathology and epidemiology.  There’s also the chance to gain practical experience of orthodontics, sedation and minor oral surgeries. As it is a relatively small organ, you need to be extremely precise — or risk causing pain to your patient. Due to this technical nature, there is only a handful of universities worldwide for you to pursue dentistry with excellence.  King’s College London, for instance, is one of the best dental schools in the UK. It ranked ninth in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2023 for dentistry.  The entry requirements to study dentistry here would be to achieve a grade A in Biology or Chemistry and a grade A in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics or Psychology. How do you actually study the human mind? That’s what you would be doing when pursuing psychology at an undergraduate level. Source: David Becker/Getty Images North America/Getty Images/AFP If you thought studying the human mind was easy, think again. This degree trains you to be skilled and interested in both scientific and social aspects of psychology, including biology and evolution, social anthropology, politics, philosophy, and sociology. While this degree is flexible, you must know how to apply it in an appropriate situation. Some graduates have managed to link psychology with human resources.  What makes psychology one of the hardest degrees in the world is how little we still know about the human mind. Unlike medicine, you can’t just amputate a gangrenous foot or let broken bones heal. Yet, so many people want to have good mental health. There is great demand for good mental well-being, but you will have limited resources and tools to help your patients. With the rise of chatbots like ChatGPT, unis have started to offer courses related to artificial intelligence. Here, you’ll learn how to design, build, and apply AI systems to your chosen areas of specialisation. To do this, a sound understanding of neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and mathematics will help you in your academic journey of uncovering the full potential of AI applications. A key reason this is considered one of the hardest degrees in the world is because we still know so little about what makes us human. What separates humans from animals? Why are there tasks that robots just can’t do? These are big questions that AI tries to answer.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: Aug 24, 2020 | Casper College News What are the five hardest classes you can take in college? Determining the five hardest classes is very subjective. If you have always been good at math, for example, then you might not find college algebra that tough. On the other hand, if you favor classes like English and literature, you may find math in general, let alone college algebra, hard. Of course, any class can be a stressor if you don’t keep up with the homework, the assigned readings, and ask for help when you need it. Casper College, as well as all other colleges, provide help for their students. None of us wants to see anyone fail a class! If you are a Casper College student, check out the Student Success Center. Center staff can help you with general studies advising, career services, testing, and more. Casper College also has plenty of tutoring and study resources, including the STEM Learning Center, the Writing Center, and the statistics lab. Now, on to those five hardest classes. After checking many sources, here are the five college classes that overall seem to give the most people a tough time. This course will separate those who have great study habits and the ability to memorize a lot of information from those who don’t and can’t. According to Webster’s, thermodynamics is “physics that deals with the mechanical action or relations of heat.” Students who make it through thermodynamics typically have no problem making it to graduation and usually get into the graduate programs of their choice. This class is tough because, again, there is a lot of memorization needed. Human anatomy deals with the structure of the human body and the parts that make up that structure like bones, muscles, tissues, organs, etc., and the way they interact or function together. To succeed in this course, you need to know all the names, both the common and scientific, of all those parts of the human body and the uses of each. To succeed in this class, students need to plan on dedicating study time to this topic. This particular class probably doesn’t come as a surprise to many readers. If you had trouble with math in high school, and many of us did, expect to find this one a challenge as well. Calculus is, according to Wikipedia, “ … the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.” BUT, don’t give up all hope if you need this class for your degree. Casper College has great tutors ready to help you in the STEM Learning Center. This is a class that you will definitely need to have a strong math background to succeed. It also requires the memorization of many formulas, which you must then be able to apply to real-life problems. Quantum physics/mechanics deals with very small particles like atoms and subatomic particles and how they work. Because this course deals in the abstract, many students struggle. This really is one of those courses that you either understand, or you don’t. It shouldn’t surprise you that organic chemistry takes the No. 1 spot as the hardest college course. This course is often referred to as the “pre-med killer” because it actually has caused many pre-med majors to switch their major. Like all the others, this class requires a strong commitment to consistent and serious studying. Not only is there a lot of memorization needed, but there is also a lot of homework. You just can’t memorize all the possible answers because there are simply too many of them. That means that you will have to rely on your intuition on occasion and generalize from specific examples. ~~~~~ How can you survive hard classes? First, remember that what might be hard for one person might not be for another. In other words, just because these are considered hard courses doesn’t mean that you can’t succeed. Take responsibility for your education. Plan ahead and try not to take two of these in the same semester. Develop good study habits and set aside time each day for coursework and needed reading, and read ahead if you can. Be sure to take notes in class, which will help you to remember information. Perhaps form a study group with your fell classmates. Give these classes the time and work they require. Finally, never hesitate to ask for help from your instructor, whether during office hours or through email. You will find that your instructors want you to succeed. And don’t forget about the help available to you on your campus through math labs, writing centers, and more.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: Listen to Story Every student aspires to pursue a course that will shape their career. Due to this, students take admission to good colleges and universities with the best courses available there. In these times, students need to learn how to overcome academic hardships and hurdles in colleges and universities. As we know, the competition in every field is increasing day by day and the selection process is also getting tougher and more focused. Sometimes, the toughest courses in the world are the ones that hold the toughest examinations. They are regarded as the toughest degree in the world due to their duration and exams. Check out the list of the 10 most difficult courses in the world. They are:1. Engineering Students who want to make a career in the engineering field are required to have tactical skills, analytical skills, critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. For a student, a background in science is crucial for a future in engineering and this begins by selecting the science stream during Classes 11 and 12. From there, a student's life begins when they have to take university entrance examinations and pass the hurdles in life.2. Chartered Accountancy This course is also featured on the list of the toughest courses in the world. Even though this course is a safe career path with well-paying opportunities, there is no denial about how demanding it is or how much hard work it takes to complete it. From matching balance sheets to making sure that the accounts notebook is error-free, the life of a chartered accountants is a tough one.3. Medicine The medical sciences courses find themselves quite aptly on a list of the toughest courses in the world. To begin with, Indian students have to make sure that they appear for the NEET examination. While this course takes an exceptionally long time, the entire period is spent learning rather than memorising the toughest textbooks, definitions and diagrams. There is nothing a medical student can skip because everything they learn is of the utmost importance.4. Pharmacy While medicine and pharmacy are on the same page in terms of the medical industry, both are quite different. Pharmacy is featured on the list of toughest courses in the world because of the structure and hard work it requires. Just like the other courses on the list, career prospects for this course have a wide scope and are always available. Whether it be a Bachelor of Pharmacy, Diploma in Pharmacy or PhD in pharmacy, they all have to deal with Chemistry and Biology as a whole and this can be quite daunting to some. Furthermore, they also study aspects of Ayurveda, Physiology, Drug Formulation, Human Anatomy etc.5. Architecture Architecture courses are not as simple as they sound. Contrary to popular assumption, it does not believe in interiors and exteriors alone. It also deals with the environment and its composition. Making use of sustainable, biodegradable material and processes needs the sharpest and the most considerate of minds. One of the trends students will find here is that each of the toughest courses in the world provides ample job opportunities and the potential for a lot of growth. With more colleges dedicated solely to architecture, this course is developing a fresh perspective into the minds of the younger generation and helping them literally build our future.6. Law A career in law requires patience, an understanding of ethics, high perceptive skills and a strong sense of individuality, among other things. While there are no scientific equations or mathematical problems to solve on this course, students need to sharpen their memory and be on their toes at all times. Apart from humanities students, this field is among the popular career options in commerce without maths.7. Psychology A prominent humanities subject that also intersects with medical science, psychology is also considered amongst the toughest courses in the world. Being a scientific investigation and study of the human mind, psychology is an umbrella discipline where students get to explore human behaviour in terms of varied contexts, such as individual, social, psychological, industrial, among others. A career in psychology requires you to be an excellent observer and communicator with an investigative streak and attention to detail.8. Statistics  Statistics is a worth-mentioning contender in the list of one of the toughest courses in the world. The collection of data itself has types of sampling; observational, randomised sampling, etc. To accurately represent the data, various theories and methods are applied depending on the type of data and population. There are various statistical methods, like the t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc, which are applied in almost all fields to represent any data like social and scientific research subjects. Students who want to study statistics must be good at logic, reasoning and maths. It also requires a strong memory to store many formulas and understand their application.9. Journalism Journalism is another intriguing and challenging field that requires putting personal biases at a bay. A person has to make sure that the news broadcast has been fact-checked, unbiasedly represented and accurate, which is rarely the case most of the time. A journalist needs to have an exceptional and bold communication manner, good and catching writing styles, curiosity, be truthful and a sharp memory.10. Quantum Mechanics Quantum mechanics is the subject that introspects the different forces of nature. It has given the world an insight into the elements and the physical nature of objects. It helps humans explore what lies inside the microscopic particles-atoms and subatoms, which makes it one of the toughest courses in the world. People who study quantum mechanics should be very well versed with the manipulation of complex numbers, integral calculus, basic profitability, functional integration and analysis etc. Students who have to study for a bachelor’s, as well as a master’s in physics, will help in honing the basic and advanced elements that this subject offers.

Sometimes, the toughest courses in the world are the ones that hold the toughest examinations. They are regarded as the toughest degree in the world due to their duration and exams. Check out the list of the 10 most difficult courses in the world. They are:1. Engineering Students who want to make a career in the engineering field are required to have tactical skills, analytical skills, critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. For a student, a background in science is crucial for a future in engineering and this begins by selecting the science stream during Classes 11 and 12. From there, a student&#x27;s life begins when they have to take university entrance examinations and pass the hurdles in life.2. Chartered Accountancy This course is also featured on the list of the toughest courses in the world. Even though this course is a safe career path with well-paying opportunities, there is no denial about how demanding it is or how much hard work it takes to complete it. From matching balance sheets to making sure that the accounts notebook is error-free, the life of a chartered accountants is a tough one.3. Medicine The medical sciences courses find themselves quite aptly on a list of the toughest courses in the world. To begin with, Indian students have to make sure that they appear for the NEET examination. While this course takes an exceptionally long time, the entire period is spent learning rather than memorising the toughest textbooks, definitions and diagrams. There is nothing a medical student can skip because everything they learn is of the utmost importance.4. Pharmacy While medicine and pharmacy are on the same page in terms of the medical industry, both are quite different. Pharmacy is featured on the list of toughest courses in the world because of the structure and hard work it requires. Just like the other courses on the list, career prospects for this course have a wide scope and are always available. Whether it be a Bachelor of Pharmacy, Diploma in Pharmacy or PhD in pharmacy, they all have to deal with Chemistry and Biology as a whole and this can be quite daunting to some. Furthermore, they also study aspects of Ayurveda, Physiology, Drug Formulation, Human Anatomy etc.5. Architecture Architecture courses are not as simple as they sound. Contrary to popular assumption, it does not believe in interiors and exteriors alone. It also deals with the environment and its composition. Making use of sustainable, biodegradable material and processes needs the sharpest and the most considerate of minds. One of the trends students will find here is that each of the toughest courses in the world provides ample job opportunities and the potential for a lot of growth. With more colleges dedicated solely to architecture, this course is developing a fresh perspective into the minds of the younger generation and helping them literally build our future.6. Law A career in law requires patience, an understanding of ethics, high perceptive skills and a strong sense of individuality, among other things. While there are no scientific equations or mathematical problems to solve on this course, students need to sharpen their memory and be on their toes at all times. Apart from humanities students, this field is among the popular career options in commerce without maths.7. Psychology A prominent humanities subject that also intersects with medical science, psychology is also considered amongst the toughest courses in the world. Being a scientific investigation and study of the human mind, psychology is an umbrella discipline where students get to explore human behaviour in terms of varied contexts, such as individual, social, psychological, industrial, among others. A career in psychology requires you to be an excellent observer and communicator with an investigative streak and attention to detail.8. Statistics  Statistics is a worth-mentioning contender in the list of one of the toughest courses in the world. The collection of data itself has types of sampling; observational, randomised sampling, etc. To accurately represent the data, various theories and methods are applied depending on the type of data and population. There are various statistical methods, like the t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc, which are applied in almost all fields to represent any data like social and scientific research subjects. Students who want to study statistics must be good at logic, reasoning and maths. It also requires a strong memory to store many formulas and understand their application.9. Journalism Journalism is another intriguing and challenging field that requires putting personal biases at a bay. A person has to make sure that the news broadcast has been fact-checked, unbiasedly represented and accurate, which is rarely the case most of the time. A journalist needs to have an exceptional and bold communication manner, good and catching writing styles, curiosity, be truthful and a sharp memory.10. Quantum Mechanics Quantum mechanics is the subject that introspects the different forces of nature. It has given the world an insight into the elements and the physical nature of objects. It helps humans explore what lies inside the microscopic particles-atoms and subatoms, which makes it one of the toughest courses in the world. People who study quantum mechanics should be very well versed with the manipulation of complex numbers, integral calculus, basic profitability, functional integration and analysis etc. Students who have to study for a bachelor’s, as well as a master’s in physics, will help in honing the basic and advanced elements that this subject offers.

This also differs based on location, as salaries differ between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.  Electrical engineering is also among the toughest courses in the world among its other engineering counterparts. It studies the application of electronics, electricity, and electromagnetism and is typically applied in the robotics, construction, and transportation industries, among others. Examination methods typically include coursework, reports, presentations, and lab observations.  Circuits and analysis Electrical power and machines Mathematics for engineers and scientists Semiconductor electronics Structures, materials and dynamics  Electrical engineer Avionic systems engineer Generator engineer Systems analyst Software and systems engineer  According to the UK government, you can make £20,000 per year as a starter and £60,000 per year on an experienced level.  Unlike the other previously mentioned courses, its difficulty does not only stem from its complexity or workload but is, in fact, its study duration. To become a chartered accountant, you must finish your undergraduate programme, which lasts three to four years, depending on the country, and later take a CA course, which takes three or more years. Accounting programmes typically follow the following examination methods, which include coursework, projects, presentations, exams, and group assignments.    Accounting Business Laws Taxation Cost Accounting and Financial Management  Internal auditor Tax auditor Statutory auditor Finance controller Forensic auditor  According to Talent.com, chartered accountants can make £40,000 a year upon graduation.  A law degree’s difficulty is in the amount of reading required. This takes us to the previously mentioned difficulty of workload in terms of reading amounts, and it will also require the memorization of certain laws. Law is also often combined with other courses such as finance, human rights, ethics across various fields, and more. Law examination methods typically include exams ( can include open book exams); they also depend on essays, coursework, presentations, reports, and lastly, your dissertation.  During your law studies, you will study various useful subjects such as communication, government and history, statistics, and more. You will also study law-related subjects such as: Contract law Tort law Criminal law Constitutional/administrative law Land/property law Equity/trusts law  Tax Lawyer Defence Lawyer Arbitrator Barrister Barrister's clerk Litigators  According to the UK government, a grade 7 lawyer typically has a salary of £47,541 or £58,000 a year, depending on post-qualification experience.   Nursing is another course that is often regarded as one of the most challenging. Nursing is primarily concerned with helping different kinds of patients who are either unwell or who need support to get back to health. Nursing’s difficulty lies in the need to not only develop practical skills but also theoretical knowledge. Its other difficulty will be the long hours required to be spent in the hospital as part of ward shifts. Examination methods include reports, essays, exams, and presentations.    Nursing practice and simulation Anatomy and Physiology Pharmacology Core values and complexity in nursing knowledge and interventions Applied mental health practice  Paediatric nurse Nurse paramedic Health visitor Occupational health nurse  According to prospects, starting nurses can make a starting salary of £28,407 a year. Other courses worthy of mention include astronomy, actuarial science, biomedical engineering, and criminology.  What typically gives a course its association as a difficult course from the learner’s perspective includes:  A common characteristic of many of the toughest courses in the world is the high workload associated with them. Workload refers to the amount of work you are expected to do, and combined with a fast pace, it may lead to difficulties.  Fast pace, in an academic sense, refers to the speed at which the course material is covered, which ultimately adds to the workload. There are, however, ways to overcome this, which will be laid out in the solutions section. Solution: To overcome the issue of a fast pace and high workload, it is very important to have high time awareness, so you’ll need to create schedules and study plans that ensure you have enough time to study and revise.  You can also make yourself familiar with the course material so that you can have a little head start during your next lecture. In the incoming section, you’ll learn of the importance of making yourself familiar with new concepts in the next item on our “what makes a course difficult” list.  Students who have, for instance, a previous background in math will find the course easier than those who do not. This is one of the main indicators that gives a student a sense of whether or not this course is easy or difficult. While studying a new subject where you have no previous background, you will also have to deal with new abstract concepts as well as vocabulary. This is why various institutions offer pre-university courses, which can help students get a head start at university. No previous background knowledge can also extend to other subjects that support the course that you are currently studying. Solution: You can always get acquainted with your course prior to enrolling. This can be done in various ways, the first being looking up your intended course and its related topics. Get your hands on some old materials from the same course and get a feel for what this course has to offer. You can also start early by taking a pre-university course, which will help you get ahead at your institution. Regarding abstract concepts, students generally prefer visual subjects where visuals are used to explain complex concepts.  Students also often struggle with courses that have a high dependency on memorization, especially whenever similar concepts are presented, often leading to confusion. Solution: Students generally find applied course concepts easier to remember than theoretical concepts. You can also try to refer to practical applications of your theoretical concepts. Other factors that contribute to course difficulty include uninteresting subjects, not being able to relate to new concepts, difficult examinations, and aesthetic differences, mainly in artistic majors.    So, with all that said, what makes a study difficult is all of these efforts combined, which are commonly referred to as “academic rigour," which is the total effort exerted in a course.  Lastly, we highly encourage you to follow your passion and, most importantly, “study smart and not hard”.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: Physical Address #1 Shell Camp Owerri, Nigeria Hardest Subject in School: This question comes up a lot in education, and it could be because people are just curious. Instead of bestowing this honour upon a single academic subject, we have compiled a concise yet illuminating list of some of the hardest subjects taught in the classroom.  We’ve split the categories into high school and college to identify the hardest subject in school. So, this article will discuss the hardest subjects in the two categories.  Table of Contents A hard subject takes time and mental strength to learn and understand. Some students might find this subject easy, while others might find it difficult. Research on the “perceived disparity in the difficulty of different subjects” found that students typically consider the following criteria while selecting courses:  The idea that a particular field of study is “boring” or “easy” is a perception that is often formed due to our own educational experiences or how we are taught. Some people learn best with visual aids. Thus, trying and instructing them without a model would be inefficient.  Therefore, some students may find cell biology (a visual idea) more accessible than calculus or electromagnetism, which they struggle to visualize. Memorization-based education is far more laborious and useful only temporarily. You may ace the upcoming test and then wholly blank afterwards.  Because we are conditioned to value good grades over actual learning, the cycle begins anew each time an exam rolls around. NB: According to the research, students prioritize interest and practicality over challenge when making course selections. There are various challenging math courses to choose from in high school. Only a few students consider mathematics to be an easy subject.  At the same time, the vast majority have difficulty passing the tests and spend significant time studying math.  The latter group of students finds it difficult to memorize formulas and fully comprehend the underlying principles.  In addition, the grading system for mathematics does not allow for any degree of flexibility, so there is very little room for deviations. Many different branches of mathematics and sub-disciplines of mathematics probably deserve some acknowledgement for their achievements here.  However, calculus is the most challenging of these subjects, not just to study as a student but even for the teachers that teach it.  The calculus teacher is responsible for ensuring that the student understands the basics at work, including functions, theorems, derivatives, and anti-derivatives. Calculus can be broken down into its parts, the most fundamental of which is the study of the mathematical representation of change.  This can be a challenging topic to comprehend when it is articulated using mathematical terminology. It would undoubtedly be a thorn in the flesh of the students if not taught properly. Further math is a subject that is closely related to mathematics as a single subject, and because it counts for two issues, it is regarded as one of the most challenging. You will earn both your general mathematics and qualification in further math if you choose to pursue education in further math. This is because further math is a subfield of mathematics.  This fact alone might make it one of the more challenging subjects, particularly when you consider that a significant portion of your study time will be spent concentrating on the topic. Unsurprisingly, the material covered in further math is far more advanced than that covered in pure mathematics.  This subject will help you better understand the material covered in your general math classes. Many students believe that physics is the most difficult subject in high school. Not everyone has the mental capacity to understand all those formulas, principles, and laws of physics and lab reports.  The difficulty of the ideas is the primary consideration behind this decision. In addition to this, a background in mathematics is necessary to understand this subject.  As a result, people who struggle with mathematics are almost guaranteed to find physics challenges. Reading can rapidly mount up on you if you are not an avid reader or a speedy reader. Here, you’ll have to read through the material and develop your own solutions.  Students are required to grasp vast amounts of material frequently written in archaic English and apply this knowledge by writing long essays and frustrating essay exams.  The majority of students who study in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics try to avoid taking English literature classes at all costs. If you do not have a strong background in mathematics and are a good teacher, it will be quite difficult for you to comprehend difficult topics in chemistry.  Chemistry has long been considered a difficult subject for students because of the abstract nature of many chemical principles, teaching methods used in class, and the difficulty of chemistry’s vocabulary. There are a lot of students that do not get the relevance of chemistry in everyday life. And if you find yourself in a class with students of this caliber, you are bound to struggle with this subject. Read more: College indeed has a lot of difficult courses. Just imagine courses combining the hardest subjects you took in high school, all integrated into one course.  Just like with most engineering courses that have integrated mathematics, physics, and chemistry into them, These college courses listed below are a few of what I regard as the hardest courses you can offer in college: Organic chemistry is a field of chemistry that looks at the structure, properties, and reactions of carbon-carbon covalently bonded organic compounds. Their structure formula is found by studying their structure. Even though it is a curriculum that recognizes patterns and logic, many students misunderstand that organic chemistry is all about memorizing.  Students need to understand how molecules react to one another and how simple molecular building blocks can be combined to make more complex compounds.  Instead of trying to memorize knowledge they don’t fully comprehend, students should approach organic chemistry as they would a math course and complete a significant number of practice problems. NB: Knowing the chemistry behind a reaction allows you to describe it with little more than your own experience and intuition. Moreover, organic chemistry is one of the hardest subjects in school.  Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system and how it works from a scientific point of view. The field of neuroscience is tremendously exciting but obtaining a degree in it is extremely difficult.  Given how intricate the human brain is, it stands to reason that a field of study devoted to it would also be challenging to understand. Still, the fact that neuroscience students are expected to have a working knowledge of all of them highlights how challenging this degree field is. The field of neuroscience is particularly challenging to understand since it combines abstract and physical concepts.  Because there are so many unanswered questions concerning the human brain and consciousness that can’t be satisfactorily answered by empirical research, neuroscience also incorporates components of philosophical inquiry. Astronomy is a natural science that looks at things in the sky and how they work. A degree in astronomy requires students to study one of the most complex subfields of physics, known as astrophysics, which should give you some idea of how challenging the course is.  Astronomy requires a significant amount of mathematical knowledge, which is enough for many students to decide against majoring in the course.  To perform fundamental calculations, you need to grasp differential equations and linear algebra and have the necessary reasoning skills. More so, astronomy is one of the hardest subjects in school.  Quantum mechanics is the field of study investigating the various laws and laws of nature.  It has enlightened people worldwide about the fundamentals of matter and the structure of many things. It is one of the most difficult courses available worldwide since it teaches people how to investigate what is contained within the atoms and sub-atoms that make up minuscule particles. The manipulation of complex numbers, integral calculus, basic profitability, functional integration and analysis, and other related topics should be highly familiar to anybody who studies quantum mechanics. Getting a degree in architecture may be an enriching experience.  As a result, you need to know what you’re getting into before embarking on this career path, as it is one of the most demanding. In contrast to what most people believe, it is not solely concerned with the interiors and exteriors of a building. It also discusses the environment and the makeup of the environment. Learning new things is essential, but studying also helps you grow. Self-assurance, competence, and pride can all be boosted by developing effective study habits.  You should take time away from studying to focus on other things, such as your social life and academic pursuits. Plan for breaks and full days off while establishing your study schedule.  A student’s grades will drop immediately if they don’t have the necessary study time.  On the other hand, students might improve their understanding beyond their initial impressions by delving deeper into their readings and lectures. In some cases, science is more challenging than other fields of study. A logical mind is required for arithmetic, and a logical and practical mind is required for science. Math is challenging since it requires a lot of effort and time. It’s common for students to get left behind in math class because they don’t have enough time to really “understand” the material. Most students go on to more advanced ideas with a weak basis. Sometimes the result is a shaky foundation that will eventually fall apart. Fortunately, there are a lot of online math courses available (like these) which can help you practice the subject and master it. Math is tricky to master since it requires much time and effort to learn the multi-step processes involved in solving problems. Having to go through a process more than once might quickly bore some students, which may lead to them losing interest in arithmetic altogether. Learning English is the most straightforward language to master in the entire globe. You may think I’m insane but bear with me. Compared to other languages, English doesn’t have cases, gender, word agreement, or even a grammatical structure. Hardest Subject in School: Everyone would have different opinions on such a subject matter.  Still, the subjects listed in this post as the hardest subjects in school think of the majority of persons from the research we conducted. Awesome one; I hope this article answered your question.

                    Physical Address #1 Shell Camp Owerri, Nigeria Hardest Subject in School: This question comes up a lot in education, and it could be because people are just curious. Instead of bestowing this honour upon a single academic subject, we have compiled a concise yet illuminating list of some of the hardest subjects taught in the classroom.  We’ve split the categories into high school and college to identify the hardest subject in school. So, this article will discuss the hardest subjects in the two categories.  Table of Contents A hard subject takes time and mental strength to learn and understand. Some students might find this subject easy, while others might find it difficult. Research on the “perceived disparity in the difficulty of different subjects” found that students typically consider the following criteria while selecting courses:  The idea that a particular field of study is “boring” or “easy” is a perception that is often formed due to our own educational experiences or how we are taught. Some people learn best with visual aids. Thus, trying and instructing them without a model would be inefficient.  Therefore, some students may find cell biology (a visual idea) more accessible than calculus or electromagnetism, which they struggle to visualize. Memorization-based education is far more laborious and useful only temporarily. You may ace the upcoming test and then wholly blank afterwards.  Because we are conditioned to value good grades over actual learning, the cycle begins anew each time an exam rolls around. NB: According to the research, students prioritize interest and practicality over challenge when making course selections. There are various challenging math courses to choose from in high school. Only a few students consider mathematics to be an easy subject.  At the same time, the vast majority have difficulty passing the tests and spend significant time studying math.  The latter group of students finds it difficult to memorize formulas and fully comprehend the underlying principles.  In addition, the grading system for mathematics does not allow for any degree of flexibility, so there is very little room for deviations. Many different branches of mathematics and sub-disciplines of mathematics probably deserve some acknowledgement for their achievements here.  However, calculus is the most challenging of these subjects, not just to study as a student but even for the teachers that teach it.  The calculus teacher is responsible for ensuring that the student understands the basics at work, including functions, theorems, derivatives, and anti-derivatives. Calculus can be broken down into its parts, the most fundamental of which is the study of the mathematical representation of change.  This can be a challenging topic to comprehend when it is articulated using mathematical terminology. It would undoubtedly be a thorn in the flesh of the students if not taught properly. Further math is a subject that is closely related to mathematics as a single subject, and because it counts for two issues, it is regarded as one of the most challenging. You will earn both your general mathematics and qualification in further math if you choose to pursue education in further math. This is because further math is a subfield of mathematics.  This fact alone might make it one of the more challenging subjects, particularly when you consider that a significant portion of your study time will be spent concentrating on the topic. Unsurprisingly, the material covered in further math is far more advanced than that covered in pure mathematics.  This subject will help you better understand the material covered in your general math classes. Many students believe that physics is the most difficult subject in high school. Not everyone has the mental capacity to understand all those formulas, principles, and laws of physics and lab reports.  The difficulty of the ideas is the primary consideration behind this decision. In addition to this, a background in mathematics is necessary to understand this subject.  As a result, people who struggle with mathematics are almost guaranteed to find physics challenges. Reading can rapidly mount up on you if you are not an avid reader or a speedy reader. Here, you’ll have to read through the material and develop your own solutions.  Students are required to grasp vast amounts of material frequently written in archaic English and apply this knowledge by writing long essays and frustrating essay exams.  The majority of students who study in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics try to avoid taking English literature classes at all costs. If you do not have a strong background in mathematics and are a good teacher, it will be quite difficult for you to comprehend difficult topics in chemistry.  Chemistry has long been considered a difficult subject for students because of the abstract nature of many chemical principles, teaching methods used in class, and the difficulty of chemistry’s vocabulary.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: Today we look at some of the hardest degrees in the world. While what’s hard may be a matter of perspective – because what’s difficult for one, may not be for another, there are some degrees that are generally accepted as being the hardest ones. This list is not meant to deter or demotivate in any way, but to ensure you enter the field mentally prepared for what’s coming your way. So, in this article, we will be looking at Would you earn more if you study one of the toughest courses in the world?


In school, we all have argued over which subject or which exam was harder than the others. (I was a kid who found PT the hardest.) We all have strengths and weaknesses. Some might have an aptitude for logic while some might be oriented toward languages or humanities. Then, how does one come to a consensus on this?

We begin with a disclaimer. There is no authoritative answer to this question. One cannot scientifically or objectively prove that ‘X’ is the most difficult course. However, based on the efforts that each course demands and popular student opinion, we can get a sense of some of the most challenging courses in today’s academia.
Incredibly challenging and incredibly rewarding? Yes. Does it translate proportionally in terms of compensation? The answer is both yes and no. There are a number of factors at play here. The one thing we can tell you for sure is, over the years, with more experience, your return on investment is going to be great. You will be at the top of your field, carving a niche for yourself. Will you start at a higher pay grade, compared to the graduates of the other courses? That also depends on the university you graduate from, your academic performance, and what other skills you have to offer.




What is the Hardest Degree in the Guinness World Record?


The hardest degree in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records is none! Nope, we aren’t pulling your leg. Here’s the story.

If you look up “most difficult degree” or any variant of it, Google will throw a bunch of websites at you that claim that the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is the toughest course, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
However, when you dig into the official website of Guinness, there is no record of such an award ever being given out. The reason is simple. Guinness awards are based on objective measurements. The difficulty is not something that can be objectively measured. The BSN course being associated with this tag is a result of a poll conducted on social media.
So, there is no official course called the hardest degree in the world. That does not go on to say that nursing is easy. In fact it is one of the courses listed below.



What are the most difficult university degrees in the world?


There is a set of criteria we look at, to determine why certain courses are tagged tougher. We look at the sheer volume of knowledge a student has to assimilate + the effort put in to shine academically + the number of applicants worldwide + the interdisciplinary features + the skill sets required + popular student opinion. Based on that, the toughest degrees are:


15. Foreign Languages

15. Foreign Languages
Learning a foreign language is challenging for many reasons. You are not simply learning a second language but also the culture, lifestyle and even the history of a land that is completely foreign to you. Research also shows that studying a foreign language enhances memory, lateral and critical thinking abilities, and builds an aptitude for problem-solving. In today’s globalized world, we are not limited by the borders of our nations. Knowledge of a foreign language and its literature helps you find better footing as a global citizen.
Here are the top 5 foreign language choices for 2024.

Chinese (Mandarin): About 1.2 billion people in the world speak the language and China is one of the centers of the world economy.
Spanish: Over 550 million people in the world speak Spanish. About 12% of the U.S. population uses Español at home. A knowledge of Spanish will allow you to travel or live comfortably in Spain, Mexico, Costa Rica, and large parts of the South American Continent.
Korean: With Korea’s increasing presence in the global political, economic and cultural spheres, learning Korean will also increase your chances of finding employment opportunities abroad.
French: French is the second most widely learned foreign language after English. Due to the imperial history of the world, French continues to be one of the official languages of 29 different countries.
German: One of the powerhouses of the European economy, Germany is also a global education hub, especially when it comes to STEM disciplines. So, the knowledge of German will open up a world of possibilities for you.

Career Options:
If the foreign language is your primary subject of study, then you can make your career as a translator, interpreter or working in an embassy. However, if you manage to learn a foreign language, in addition to a professional course, you can even see yourself heading international departments of organizations or rising through the ranks in the hospitality industry.
Typical Duration:
There is nothing typical about the language learning process. Research shows that you need about 480 hours and 2200 hours of language study and practice. It ultimately depends on what level of mastery you are aiming to achieve.
14. Psychology
A scientific study of an abstract concept called the human mind, psychology particularly looks at human behavior and personality. This subject gives us an in-depth insight into the diversity of human experience. While it is a vast field with numerous specializations, you are expected to at least familiarize yourself with the scientific, biological and social aspects of it. Be it evolution, the structure of the human brain, cognitive functions or social anthropology, all of them have a direct impact on the functioning of the human mind. Therefore, the academic expectations are set quite high.

12. Chemistry
For many students, right from middle school, chemistry has built a reputation of being scarily hard. Hence, it comes as no surprise that it finds a spot on this list. While the subject per se needs no introduction, the amount of time you are expected to schedule is quite high, compared to other subjects. In a week, you can expect about 10-12 lab hours, and 10-12 class hours plus the time spent on your own research and studying. You will also need to build competencies in mathematics and physics since they cannot be categorically separated, especially when it comes to experiments.
Career Options:
Starting from academic research, all the way to toxicology, careers abound in this fundamental science discipline. Your specialization can even help you become an environmental and safety specialist. Here’s our take on studying chemistry.

09. Mathematics
There is a joke that has been going around that says that math was really cute until the alphabet appeared. However, if you find yourself drawn to it, despite the English alphabet and then the greek alphabet, then maybe, this is the course for you.
At the higher education level, mathematics is a tough course because it involves a lot of abstract ideas and new developments that push the borders of the discipline almost every day. Moreover, being a math major does not mean learning pure math anymore. Interdisciplinary studies are the way ahead. That means you will also be studying a great deal of computer science, some statistics, and data analysis.
Career Options:
From simple data entry to complex research positions, mathematics is integral to every field in that you can find yourself working in any industry of your choosing.

08. Chartered Accountancy
Chartered Accountancy or CA is an international accounting degree that is granted to a student typically after 3 years of accountancy degree plus 3-4 years of training. In the international platform, the accreditation from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) is one of the hardest milestones to reach. You will develop a wide range of skills in accounting, auditing, finance, risk analysis, mathematics, computer science, and some facets of corporate law. So, hard work is the only way ahead. With the fate of entire businesses and organizations in your hand, there is little margin for error.
Note: The term CA is used in the U.K. and other commonwealth nations. In the U.S., the same is referred to as a CPA. It is not to be confused with the CA course in India, administered by the ICAI.

 In school, we all have argued over which subject or which exam was harder than the others. (I was a kid who found PT the hardest.) We all have strengths and weaknesses. Some might have an aptitude for logic while some might be oriented toward languages or humanities. Then, how does one come to a consensus on this?  We begin with a disclaimer. There is no authoritative answer to this question. One cannot scientifically or objectively prove that ‘X’ is the most difficult course. However, based on the efforts that each course demands and popular student opinion, we can get a sense of some of the most challenging courses in today’s academia. Incredibly challenging and incredibly rewarding? Yes. Does it translate proportionally in terms of compensation? The answer is both yes and no. There are a number of factors at play here. The one thing we can tell you for sure is, over the years, with more experience, your return on investment is going to be great. You will be at the top of your field, carving a niche for yourself. Will you start at a higher pay grade, compared to the graduates of the other courses? That also depends on the university you graduate from, your academic performance, and what other skills you have to offer.  What is the Hardest Degree in the Guinness World Record?


The hardest degree in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records is none! Nope, we aren’t pulling your leg. Here’s the story.

If you look up “most difficult degree” or any variant of it, Google will throw a bunch of websites at you that claim that the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is the toughest course, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
However, when you dig into the official website of Guinness, there is no record of such an award ever being given out. The reason is simple. Guinness awards are based on objective measurements. The difficulty is not something that can be objectively measured. The BSN course being associated with this tag is a result of a poll conducted on social media.
So, there is no official course called the hardest degree in the world. That does not go on to say that nursing is easy. In fact it is one of the courses listed below.



What are the most difficult university degrees in the world?


There is a set of criteria we look at, to determine why certain courses are tagged tougher. We look at the sheer volume of knowledge a student has to assimilate + the effort put in to shine academically + the number of applicants worldwide + the interdisciplinary features + the skill sets required + popular student opinion. Based on that, the toughest degrees are:


15. Foreign Languages
14. Psychology
13. Statistics
12. Chemistry
11. Physics
10. Engineering

15. Foreign Languages
Learning a foreign language is challenging for many reasons. You are not simply learning a second language but also the culture, lifestyle and even the history of a land that is completely foreign to you. Research also shows that studying a foreign language enhances memory, lateral and critical thinking abilities, and builds an aptitude for problem-solving. In today’s globalized world, we are not limited by the borders of our nations. Knowledge of a foreign language and its literature helps you find better footing as a global citizen.
Here are the top 5 foreign language choices for 2024.

Chinese (Mandarin): About 1.2 billion people in the world speak the language and China is one of the centers of the world economy.
Spanish: Over 550 million people in the world speak Spanish. About 12% of the U.S. population uses Español at home. A knowledge of Spanish will allow you to travel or live comfortably in Spain, Mexico, Costa Rica, and large parts of the South American Continent.
Korean: With Korea’s increasing presence in the global political, economic and cultural spheres, learning Korean will also increase your chances of finding employment opportunities abroad.
French: French is the second most widely learned foreign language after English. Due to the imperial history of the world, French continues to be one of the official languages of 29 different countries.
German: One of the powerhouses of the European economy, Germany is also a global education hub, especially when it comes to STEM disciplines. So, the knowledge of German will open up a world of possibilities for you.

Career Options:
If the foreign language is your primary subject of study, then you can make your career as a translator, interpreter or working in an embassy. However, if you manage to learn a foreign language, in addition to a professional course, you can even see yourself heading international departments of organizations or rising through the ranks in the hospitality industry.
Typical Duration:
There is nothing typical about the language learning process. Research shows that you need about 480 hours and 2200 hours of language study and practice. It ultimately depends on what level of mastery you are aiming to achieve.
14. Psychology
A scientific study of an abstract concept called the human mind, psychology particularly looks at human behavior and personality. This subject gives us an in-depth insight into the diversity of human experience.

 The hardest degree in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records is none! Nope, we aren’t pulling your leg. Here’s the story.  If you look up “most difficult degree” or any variant of it, Google will throw a bunch of websites at you that claim that the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is the toughest course, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. However, when you dig into the official website of Guinness, there is no record of such an award ever being given out. The reason is simple. Guinness awards are based on objective measurements. The difficulty is not something that can be objectively measured. The BSN course being associated with this tag is a result of a poll conducted on social media. So, there is no official course called the hardest degree in the world. That does not go on to say that nursing is easy. In fact it is one of the courses listed below. What are the most difficult university degrees in the world?


There is a set of criteria we look at, to determine why certain courses are tagged tougher. We look at the sheer volume of knowledge a student has to assimilate + the effort put in to shine academically + the number of applicants worldwide + the interdisciplinary features + the skill sets required + popular student opinion. Based on that, the toughest degrees are:


15. Foreign Languages

There are multiple reasons why medicine and dentistry courses top this list.

The competition is fierce, both for enrollment in a medical school and in terms of career. The acceptance rate in universities is fairly low. (For instance, it is at around 12% at Oxford)
It is filled with challenging subjects and a vast curriculum.
The hours, be it as a student or as a practitioner, are long.
The amount of time you invest in training is extremely long, compared to any other course. There is typically two years of a foundation course, followed by two to three years of solid medical training. Then comes the specialist training that can take anywhere from 4 – 7 years.
The pressure of being directly responsible for human lives, especially in a post-pandemic medical burnout.

But, despite all the reasons why it is one of the toughest courses, it still remains one of the most popular courses. A career in medicine often becomes a vocation, rather than a profession.

                    Today we look at some of the hardest degrees in the world. While what’s hard may be a matter of perspective – because what’s difficult for one, may not be for another, there are some degrees that are generally accepted as being the hardest ones. This list is not meant to deter or demotivate in any way, but to ensure you enter the field mentally prepared for what’s coming your way. So, in this article, we will be looking at Would you earn more if you study one of the toughest courses in the world?


In school, we all have argued over which subject or which exam was harder than the others. (I was a kid who found PT the hardest.) We all have strengths and weaknesses. Some might have an aptitude for logic while some might be oriented toward languages or humanities. Then, how does one come to a consensus on this?

We begin with a disclaimer. There is no authoritative answer to this question. One cannot scientifically or objectively prove that ‘X’ is the most difficult course. However, based on the efforts that each course demands and popular student opinion, we can get a sense of some of the most challenging courses in today’s academia.
Incredibly challenging and incredibly rewarding? Yes. Does it translate proportionally in terms of compensation? The answer is both yes and no. There are a number of factors at play here. The one thing we can tell you for sure is, over the years, with more experience, your return on investment is going to be great. You will be at the top of your field, carving a niche for yourself. Will you start at a higher pay grade, compared to the graduates of the other courses? That also depends on the university you graduate from, your academic performance, and what other skills you have to offer.




What is the Hardest Degree in the Guinness World Record?


The hardest degree in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records is none! Nope, we aren’t pulling your leg. Here’s the story.

If you look up “most difficult degree” or any variant of it, Google will throw a bunch of websites at you that claim that the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is the toughest course, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
However, when you dig into the official website of Guinness, there is no record of such an award ever being given out. The reason is simple. Guinness awards are based on objective measurements. The difficulty is not something that can be objectively measured. The BSN course being associated with this tag is a result of a poll conducted on social media.
So, there is no official course called the hardest degree in the world. That does not go on to say that nursing is easy. In fact it is one of the courses listed below.



What are the most difficult university degrees in the world?


There is a set of criteria we look at, to determine why certain courses are tagged tougher. We look at the sheer volume of knowledge a student has to assimilate + the effort put in to shine academically + the number of applicants worldwide + the interdisciplinary features + the skill sets required + popular student opinion. Based on that, the toughest degrees are:


15. Foreign Languages

15. Foreign Languages
Learning a foreign language is challenging for many reasons. You are not simply learning a second language but also the culture, lifestyle and even the history of a land that is completely foreign to you. Research also shows that studying a foreign language enhances memory, lateral and critical thinking abilities, and builds an aptitude for problem-solving. In today’s globalized world, we are not limited by the borders of our nations. Knowledge of a foreign language and its literature helps you find better footing as a global citizen.
Here are the top 5 foreign language choices for 2024.

Chinese (Mandarin): About 1.2 billion people in the world speak the language and China is one of the centers of the world economy.
Spanish: Over 550 million people in the world speak Spanish. About 12% of the U.S. population uses Español at home. A knowledge of Spanish will allow you to travel or live comfortably in Spain, Mexico, Costa Rica, and large parts of the South American Continent.
Korean: With Korea’s increasing presence in the global political, economic and cultural spheres, learning Korean will also increase your chances of finding employment opportunities abroad.
French: French is the second most widely learned foreign language after English. Due to the imperial history of the world, French continues to be one of the official languages of 29 different countries.
German: One of the powerhouses of the European economy, Germany is also a global education hub, especially when it comes to STEM disciplines. So, the knowledge of German will open up a world of possibilities for you.

Career Options:
If the foreign language is your primary subject of study, then you can make your career as a translator, interpreter or working in an embassy. However, if you manage to learn a foreign language, in addition to a professional course, you can even see yourself heading international departments of organizations or rising through the ranks in the hospitality industry.
Typical Duration:
There is nothing typical about the language learning process. Research shows that you need about 480 hours and 2200 hours of language study and practice. It ultimately depends on what level of mastery you are aiming to achieve.
14. Psychology
A scientific study of an abstract concept called the human mind, psychology particularly looks at human behavior and personality. This subject gives us an in-depth insight into the diversity of human experience. While it is a vast field with numerous specializations, you are expected to at least familiarize yourself with the scientific, biological and social aspects of it. Be it evolution, the structure of the human brain, cognitive functions or social anthropology, all of them have a direct impact on the functioning of the human mind. Therefore, the academic expectations are set quite high.
Not just with the learning process, but in terms of career, a degree in psychology requires you to have good communication and people skills, since it primarily involves dealing with people and their stories.

01. Medicine, Dentistry
There are multiple reasons why medicine and dentistry courses top this list.

The competition is fierce, both for enrollment in a medical school and in terms of career. The acceptance rate in universities is fairly low. (For instance, it is at around 12% at Oxford)
It is filled with challenging subjects and a vast curriculum.
The hours, be it as a student or as a practitioner, are long.
The amount of time you invest in training is extremely long, compared to any other course. There is typically two years of a foundation course, followed by two to three years of solid medical training. Then comes the specialist training that can take anywhere from 4 – 7 years.
The pressure of being directly responsible for human lives, especially in a post-pandemic medical burnout.

But, despite all the reasons why it is one of the toughest courses, it still remains one of the most popular courses. A career in medicine often becomes a vocation, rather than a profession.

 In school, we all have argued over which subject or which exam was harder than the others. (I was a kid who found PT the hardest.) We all have strengths and weaknesses. Some might have an aptitude for logic while some might be oriented toward languages or humanities. Then, how does one come to a consensus on this?  We begin with a disclaimer. There is no authoritative answer to this question. One cannot scientifically or objectively prove that ‘X’ is the most difficult course. However, based on the efforts that each course demands and popular student opinion, we can get a sense of some of the most challenging courses in today’s academia. Incredibly challenging and incredibly rewarding? Yes. Does it translate proportionally in terms of compensation? The answer is both yes and no. There are a number of factors at play here. The one thing we can tell you for sure is, over the years, with more experience, your return on investment is going to be great. You will be at the top of your field, carving a niche for yourself. Will you start at a higher pay grade, compared to the graduates of the other courses? That also depends on the university you graduate from, your academic performance, and what other skills you have to offer.  What is the Hardest Degree in the Guinness World Record?


The hardest degree in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records is none! Nope, we aren’t pulling your leg. Here’s the story.

If you look up “most difficult degree” or any variant of it, Google will throw a bunch of websites at you that claim that the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is the toughest course, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
However, when you dig into the official website of Guinness, there is no record of such an award ever being given out. The reason is simple. Guinness awards are based on objective measurements. The difficulty is not something that can be objectively measured. The BSN course being associated with this tag is a result of a poll conducted on social media.
So, there is no official course called the hardest degree in the world. That does not go on to say that nursing is easy. In fact it is one of the courses listed below.



What are the most difficult university degrees in the world?


There is a set of criteria we look at, to determine why certain courses are tagged tougher. We look at the sheer volume of knowledge a student has to assimilate + the effort put in to shine academically + the number of applicants worldwide + the interdisciplinary features + the skill sets required + popular student opinion. Based on that, the toughest degrees are:

01. Medicine, Dentistry
There are multiple reasons why medicine and dentistry courses top this list.

The competition is fierce, both for enrollment in a medical school and in terms of career. The acceptance rate in universities is fairly low. (For instance, it is at around 12% at Oxford)
It is filled with challenging subjects and a vast curriculum.
The hours, be it as a student or as a practitioner, are long.
The amount of time you invest in training is extremely long, compared to any other course. There is typically two years of a foundation course, followed by two to three years of solid medical training. Then comes the specialist training that can take anywhere from 4 – 7 years.
The pressure of being directly responsible for human lives, especially in a post-pandemic medical burnout.

But, despite all the reasons why it is one of the toughest courses, it still remains one of the most popular courses. A career in medicine often becomes a vocation, rather than a profession.

 There is a set of criteria we look at, to determine why certain courses are tagged tougher. We look at the sheer volume of knowledge a student has to assimilate + the effort put in to shine academically + the number of applicants worldwide + the interdisciplinary features + the skill sets required + popular student opinion. Based on that, the toughest degrees are:  Learning a foreign language is challenging for many reasons. You are not simply learning a second language but also the culture, lifestyle and even the history of a land that is completely foreign to you. Research also shows that studying a foreign language enhances memory, lateral and critical thinking abilities, and builds an aptitude for problem-solving. In today’s globalized world, we are not limited by the borders of our nations. Knowledge of a foreign language and its literature helps you find better footing as a global citizen. Here are the top 5 foreign language choices for 2024. If the foreign language is your primary subject of study, then you can make your career as a translator, interpreter or working in an embassy. However, if you manage to learn a foreign language, in addition to a professional course, you can even see yourself heading international departments of organizations or rising through the ranks in the hospitality industry. There is nothing typical about the language learning process. Research shows that you need about 480 hours and 2200 hours of language study and practice. It ultimately depends on what level of mastery you are aiming to achieve. A scientific study of an abstract concept called the human mind, psychology particularly looks at human behavior and personality. This subject gives us an in-depth insight into the diversity of human experience. While it is a vast field with numerous specializations, you are expected to at least familiarize yourself with the scientific, biological and social aspects of it. Be it evolution, the structure of the human brain, cognitive functions or social anthropology, all of them have a direct impact on the functioning of the human mind. Therefore, the academic expectations are set quite high. Not just with the learning process, but in terms of career, a degree in psychology requires you to have good communication and people skills, since it primarily involves dealing with people and their stories. Psychologist, Therapist, Social Worker, Forensic Psychologist, the specializations and options are endless. An undergraduate degree is usually 3 or 4 years long while a Master’s Degree in Psychology is 2 years.

In our case,  that&#x27;s TC Global. Any cookie we place ourselves is a &quot;first-party cookie.&quot; Third-party cookies are cookies placed on our domains by trusted partners that we&#x27;ve  allowed to do so. These can be social media partners, advertising partners,  security providers, and more. And they can be either &quot;session cookies&quot; or  &quot;permanent cookies&quot;: Session cookies only exist until you close your browser, ending what&#x27;s called  your &quot;session.&quot; Then they&#x27;re deleted. Permanent cookies have a range of lifespans and stay on your device after the  browser is closed. On the Site, we try to only serve permanent cookies (or  allow permanent cookies to be served by third parties) that have a limited  lifespan. However, for security reasons or in other exceptional circumstances,  sometimes we may need to give a cookie a longer lifespan. Web browser cookies may store info such as your IP address or other identifiers, your  browser type, and info about the content you view and interact with on digital  services. By storing this info, web browser cookies can remember your  preferences and settings for online services and analyze how you use them. Along with cookies, we also use tracking technologies that are  very similar. Our Site may contain small transparent image files or lines of  code that record how you interact with them. These include &quot;web beacons,&quot;  &quot;scripts,&quot; &quot;tracking URLs,&quot; or &quot;software development kits&quot; (known as SDKs): Web beacons have a lot of different names. They might also be known as web  bugs, tracking bugs, tags, web tags, page tags, tracking pixels, pixel tags,  1x1 GIFs, or clear GIFs. In short, these beacons are a tiny graphic image of  just one pixel that can be delivered to your device as part of a web page  request, in an app, an advertisement, or an HTML email message. They can be  used to retrieve info from your device, such as your device type, operating  system, IP address, and the time of your visit. They are also used to serve and  read cookies in your browser or to trigger the placement of a cookie. Scripts are small computer programs embedded within our web pages that give  those pages a wide variety of extra functionality. Scripts make it possible for  the website to function properly. For example, scripts power certain security  features and enable basic interactive features on our website. Scripts can also  be used for analytical or advertising purposes. For example, a script can  collect info about how you use our website, such as which pages you visit or  what you search for. Tracking URLs are links with a unique identifier in them. These are used to  track which website brought you to the Site. An example woold be if you clicked  from a social media page, search engine, or one of our affiliate partners&#x27;  websites. Software Development  Kits (SDKs) are part of our apps&#x27;  source code. Unlike browser cookies, SDK data is stored in the app storage.  They&#x27;re used to analyze how the apps are being used or to send personalized  push notifications. To do this, they record unique identifiers associated with  your device, like your device ID, IP address, in-app activity, and network location. All  these tracking technologies are referred to as &quot;cookies&quot; here in this Cookie  Statement.
  However,  no Personal Information identifying the user is collected nor any data capture  mechanisms are employed.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: Math Science More Community By Jennifer J on July 24, 2022 ﻿ What Makes a Subject Harder? Jennifer J  What makes a subject hard or easy? At first glance, it seems that the answer is pretty straightforward. Our interests, likes, and dislikes dictate our understanding and perspective on a subject. Some find the unknown exciting no matter how hard it is to understand it. For them, it is interesting because it is hard. Others, like me, find something interesting because it is easier to comprehend. ﻿ According to a study conducted on 'perceived disparity in the difficulty of different subjects,' there are three factors that students usually use to decide which subjects they wish to pursue: Subject difficulty (perception), enjoyment, and usefulness (in their future). The study also stated that students often put more weight on enjoyment and usefulness rather than difficulty when selecting their preferred subjects. ﻿ Hence, choosing traditionally 'hard' topics can be an interesting decision. I was curious to know what subjects the learners of the Schoolhouse.world would find challenging or easy. As a tutor at Schoolhouse. World, I had the opportunity to conduct a general survey, and ask the learners a couple of questions.  ﻿ ﻿ Before we jump to the results, let us define what exactly are considered 'hard' subjects. ﻿ Perception: Perception is the 'traditional' belief that a subject is “boring” or “easy”, usually based upon what our school taught us or, more specifically, their method of teaching the subject. For example, Math is generally taught in concise and logical steps. In contrast, Biology is often taught in paragraphs that are often factual and lengthy. These differing teaching styles translate into some bias within students.  ﻿ In a study by Benjamin M. P. Cuff, the students admitted to choosing subjects based on the advice of their peers, family, and teachers. Another study conducted by the Dept of Education (University of Calicut, India) probed high school students’ feelings on mathematics. The study showed a strong association of the difficulty of Math with the dislike for Math, implying students disliked Math cause they perceived it was hard or believed that they won't be able to do Math ( Self-efficacy). ﻿ We generally use two basic methods to learn/study any subject: memorization (By heart learning) or logic ( reasoning). We rely on both the tools to learn anything, albeit their ratio might differ depending upon the subject or, in particular, how we are taught the subject. For example, numerical-based subjects such as Math and Physics are learned based on reasoning. In contrast, Chemistry and Biology are often retained by relying on the power of memorization. ﻿ Other studies were conducted to measure the difficulty of different topics in a particular subject at elementary and secondary education levels in Biology, History, and Math. From the results from all these articles, specific keywords are often used to describe the difficulty of the subject: 'complicated,'' difficult,'' require memorizing,' and 'boring.' ﻿ Relatability: Everyone’s brain is built differently, and the Education system cannot use a defined method to universally test all learners' knowledge. Therefore, the current system prevents us from unlocking the potential of an individual learner. ﻿ Some people understand better when there is a visual representation, so teaching them without a model would make it harder for them to learn. Hence, some find cell biology (quite a visual concept) easier than calculus or electromagnetism, subjects that the students cannot visualize easily. According to one study, a hands-on approach or familiarity with the subject to the learner makes it easier to understand. ﻿ Rote-learning : Learning based on memory is far more taxing and has a short-term application. So, you might pass with flying colors on the coming exam and then forget everything. The process is again repeated when the next exam comes along, because we are led to believe that grades are more important than knowledge.   ﻿ A survey conducted on undergraduate and graduate students showed that academic performance is much more dependent on deep understanding than rote learning.
We often forget that what we learn in school will help us; we probably don't need it to get a job, do well in life, or in no way directly affect us. But, having a good understanding goes a long way in our daily life. For example, knowing the country's history can
offer better understanding of the country's current decision-making and help form a better opinion of the policies. What about subjects like chemistry, biology, physics or math? Where do they find a place? No one utilizes calculus or chemical reactions every day; besides, with Dr. Google helping us out, you would think there is no need for learning such concepts. Yet you need the knowledge to interpret them. You had medicine before; have you ever read the back of the prescription? Wondered what the side effects of the medication were? Or what about why some doctors suggest the medicine be taken before eating? Probably not, yet we follow the instructions blindly, never taking our time to understand them. ﻿ Results and inferences
Isn't it better to learn once? Hence, we find logic a better tool for learning. It is one of the reasons why 71% of learners in the survey preferred Math over any other subjects. ﻿ The other reason that makes a subject interesting, according to the survey, is to understand our world a little better. This interest is not specific to a topic. Depending upon the individual's preference, they find biology, philosophy, or other subjects fascinating.
In contrast to the first question, the second question sheds a little light on the 'problem' of the current education system. Synonyms for words like 'Memorization,' 'Complicated,' and 'Boring' are used as a reason to dislike subjects ranging from chemistry to computer languages. ﻿ Only around ~20 % of those surveyed did not loathe studying.  Which then begs the question, which subjects do learners find hard? And is there a relation to their way of learning? My third and fourth questions try to quantify this.   ﻿ 28 learners rated 6 subjects from 1 to 5: Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, and Environmental Science.
First, the rate of difficulty of the subject :
1-2: These subjects are hard to learn or study
3: These subjects are not too hard nor too easy to learn
4-5: These subjects are easy to learn. 
 
 ﻿ Figure One ﻿ It is clearly seen that most learners find Math easy. While Physics is something most learners find hard or not easy to learn. Most learners prefer Chemistry and Biology in the 3-4 range, easy to not hard.   ﻿ Both come averagely around the easy subject range when we plot for environmental science and computer science.  In conclusion, except for physics, all other subjects are easy to learn. Still, since there is a lot of variation in opinion amongst learners in Physics, thus, it will be hard to predict whether most learners indeed find the subject hard? This was surprising since previous questions indicated a partiality to logic over rote-learning, which I believed would be translated to the difficulty of the subject. Yet, most subjects scored a higher number indicating maybe we don't rely too much on one tool to learn.  Considering this hypothesis that there is no relation between the difficulty of the subject and learning of it, we will look into the fourth question: which method (Memorization or Reasoning) do they use to learn each subject. ﻿ Again, I asked the participants to rate the same 6 subjects from 1-to 10.
1-3: Learning mainly/solely based on Memorization.
4-6: Learning through Memorization and Reasoning
7-10: Learning mainly/solely based on Reasoning 
 ﻿ Fig 2 ﻿ Based on the data, most of the learners considered Math the most logical while Biology the least logical.
Incredibly, all these subjects are pretty interdisciplinary, relying on one another. For example, using math to explain heredity, chemistry to explain digestion, physics to explain walking, and many more natural phenomena. These phenomena share one trait, i.e., all of them can be explained through reasoning (solely or with little memorization, something we generally do for Math or Physics; remembering formulas), yet we still rely heavily on memorizing specific subjects.  Comparing Environmental science and Computer science, we can find something similar to the above statement. We cannot clearly see a pattern when comparing the box plots. 
 ﻿ Fig 3 ﻿ But, to confirm that there might not be some association between the difficulty and learning method, I did a correlation test between the difficulty and learning method. The blue color indicates a positive association, and red indicates a negative association, while the intensity of the color and size determines the strength of the association: a paler and smaller circle means a weaker association.   We will look into the diagonal row since that will give an idea of the correlation. The rest of the figure provides an association between the learning method and the difficulty of the subjects with each other. ﻿ Fig 4 ﻿ Overall, there is a positive correlation between the learning method and the difficulty of the subject. There is a strong positive correlation between Biology and Physics, while a weak correlation is seen in other subjects.   ﻿ This means that in Biology and Physics, more learners find Biology easy and study biology with more use of memorization. On the other hand, learners associate Physics with a complex subject and use reasoning and memorization.  The weaker association might be due to high variation that can be corrected with a higher sample size. ﻿ From the tutors point of view
After getting the perspective of subjects from the learners' point of view, I wanted to learn about the tutors' perspectives. 18 tutors responded to 4 questions: the first and second questions asking which subjects were the hardest and easiest for learners to understand from the perspective of tutors. The other two questions asked which subjects were the most complicated and straightforward to teach learners.   ﻿ Most of the tutors believed that learners struggle with mathematics. Only a few felt that the learners also struggled in physics and biology, though the reasons for 'why' are pretty varied. Some tutors believe because of the misconception that 'Math is hard'; others believe that it is due to various concepts ( some of which are abstract ) and practice makes it a challenging subject to learn. ﻿ This might explain why the learners ( from the previous survey) found Math easy. The more one understands, the easier it becomes. And at SHW, there are more Math tutors than in other subjects; hence this could be the reason learners who took the survey found Math to be easy. ﻿ On the other hand, the easiest subject for learners was a little hard to pinpoint since the answers ranged from literature to history to science subjects such as Biology, Chemistry, etc. The reason remained reasonably consistent: because of application to the real world.   ﻿ Regarding which subjects it is the easiest to teach, there is again no consistency. Though more tutors find Math over Physics easier to tutor, this can be attributed to the small data sample or more Math tutors at SHW.   ﻿ Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed this fun survey of SHW, and I thank all those who participated in it. Note that due to the small sample size, the results might not show the true nature when extrapolated. Also, since there is no specific age for the participants, the learners in the younger grade might find one subject easier than the older learners. ﻿ Conclusion: There are multiple reasons why we find a subject tricky or easy. Still, in my experience as a learner, the lack of connectivity makes a subject very hard to grasp even when you understand the concepts.. I was a freshman taking Phy 101: Electromagnetism. Now I understood what my professor said; I certainly had no doubts, but the concept didn't sit with me. So I joined the group of students around the prof asking doubts, hoping that something wrong would be corrected. I guess I was not the only one feeling that way, but the way the student framed the question echoed with me, and the professor understood. The student said that he understood the concepts but didn't feel it. So, 'feeling' is crucial because it is the road to understanding. And probably the first steps to enjoying 'hard' concepts. ﻿ So, next time a concept doesn't feel right with you, no matter how well you understand, say it out loud. ﻿ Happy learning! ﻿ References: Cuff, Benjamin MP.

This saves students time and money in college and allows them to pursue more advanced coursework or explore other areas of interest. Moreover, AP classes allow students to experience the academic rigor of college-level courses while still in high school. This exposure can better prepare them for the challenges they will face in higher education, including time management, critical thinking, and practical study skills. IB courses follow a similar structure to AP classes but are part of a broader program focusing on international education and holistic learning. In addition to the challenging coursework, IB students are required to complete an extended essay on a theory of knowledge course and participate in creative, action, and service (CAS) activities. The extended essay is an independent research project that allows students to explore a topic of their choice in-depth. This project develops their research and writing skills and encourages them to think critically and analytically. On the other hand, the theory of knowledge course challenges students to question the nature of knowledge and explore different ways of knowing. Furthermore, IB courses emphasize the importance of cultural awareness and global perspectives. Through the CAS activities, students engage in creative pursuits, physical activities, and community service, fostering a well-rounded education beyond the classroom. This holistic approach to learning prepares students to become active, compassionate, and lifelong learners. The sciences have always been considered challenging due to their complexity and the need for logical thinking. High school students who take advanced science classes face even more significant challenges as they navigate the intricacies of physics, chemistry, and biology. 







 Physics is often regarded as one of the most challenging scientific disciplines when exploring the world of science.

Additionally, laboratory work is essential to biology classes, allowing students to observe and analyze living organisms firsthand. From exploring the wonders of the human body to understanding the delicate balance of ecosystems, biology offers endless opportunities for discovery. While the sciences present challenges, the humanities have their fair share of complexity. Literature, history, and philosophy demand critical thinking, interpretation, and analysis. 







 High school literature classes often assign challenging texts like Shakespearean plays or dense novels. Students must be prepared to analyze and interpret these works, providing evidence and constructing well-structured arguments. History offers a rich tapestry of events and ideas that shaped the world we live in today. It requires students to comprehend complex cause-and-effect relationships, understand different historical perspectives, and analyze primary and secondary sources. Philosophy, the study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, and ethics, is a subject that challenges students to think deeply and argue logically. High school philosophy classes explore morality, the nature of reality, and the meaning of life. Students must grapple with abstract concepts and engage in philosophical discussions. Studying literature requires a keen eye for detail and an appreciation for the nuances within the text. It involves unraveling the layers of meaning embedded in the words, sentences, and paragraphs. It consists in deciphering the author’s intentions and understanding the social, political, and cultural influences that shaped their work. Furthermore, literature allows for the exploration of different literary movements and genres. Students can delve into the diverse range of academic expressions throughout history, from Romanticism to Modernism, poetry to prose. They can analyze authors’ stylistic choices and trace literary techniques’ evolution. High school history classes often cover broad topics such as world history, American history, or European history, requiring students to digest and synthesize vast amounts of information.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: Emmanuel Onalo July 26, 2023 College students graduating with a science degree routinely have employment opportunities. Once employed, they benefit from high salaries and strong levels of job security. Achieving a degree in science is not easy. However; successful science students possess strong math skills, a natural curiosity, persistence, and the ability to work within a team. Given that science is a broad field encompassing majors from biology to physics, some majors are easier than others. Below is a list of the hardest bachelor’s degrees in science. Get Up to $100,000 Student Loan for Your Master in US or Canada - See if you are eligible 1. Chemistry Chemistry degree is famous for being one of the hardest subjects. Just one topic in Chemistry (for example, organic chemistry) is incredibly complex. As well as involving huge amounts of memorization, organic chemistry covers more than 15 million compounds, and there are an infinite amount of organic chemical reactions to investigate. Then, take the fact that Chemistry has multiple topics as well as organic chemistry, including inorganic chemistry (which involves learning about molecular orbital theory, acids and atomic structure) and physical chemistry (which you need to be a maths whizz to understand), and you get the picture. If you were to study Chemistry at a top university like the University of Oxford, your weekly schedule would look something like this: 12 hours of labs, 10 hours of lectures, 1 Chemistry tutorial and tutorials in Maths, Biochemistry or Physics, where you’ll learn things, you can apply to Chemistry. Chemistry is one of those subjects where you have to have advanced knowledge of maths and physics because these subjects tie so much into Chemistry. If you struggle with mathematical and logical thinking, Chemistry may be the degree to avoid. Also, there’s a lot of practical learning involved in Chemistry, which means that when you’re not trying to get your head around macromolecules and redox reactions, you’ll be spending the rest of your time in the lab. This brings with it a whole new skill set, including writing lab reports and carrying out complex experiments, to put your learning into practice. 2. Astronomy An Astronomy degree involves studying one of the most advanced branches of physics (Astrophysics), which gives you a clue as to how hard it is. Like with any hard science, astronomers have to make falsifiable predictions about space and the universe, which they have to test in a controlled environment. Sciences like Astronomy necessarily involve a lot of failures, as you continually experiment with hypotheses to try and reach a conclusion. It’s not the same as just having an idea: if you can’t follow through with it, it’s not worth much. There’s also a lot of mathematics in Astronomy, which is enough to put many students off. You’ve got to have the logical skills to do basic special relativity calculations, as well as understanding differential equations and linear algebra. However, if you love exploring space, stars and the planets and the very complex mathematics and physics behind them, Astronomy may well be the subject for you. 3. Physics Physics is an astoundingly rigorous degree. It’s one thing to find the general ideas of Physics interesting (after all, who wouldn’t be interested in a subject that explores the very make-up of the universe, from the mystery of black holes to the waves of the electromagnetic spectrum?). But it is quite another to dive into the mathematical principles, complex formulas and calculations within each area of Physics, and apply them enough to excel in your exams. There are no shortcuts to understanding Physics, which is what makes it such a hard degree. The truth about STEM subjects like Maths and the Sciences is that while there is plenty of information, as well as plenty of formulas, to memorise, it’s not enough to know the correct answer to something. You need to understand why and how it is the correct answer. While you might just get away with rote learning equations and formulas in A-Level Physics, this won’t fly at degree level. One of the most important things to know about a Physics degree is that if you’re confused, you’re doing something right! What this means, is that to truly understand Physics (rather than just find out the answers to solutions without understanding their application), you have to sit down and sweat it out over those formulas, and accept that the answer is going to take a long time to come. Allow yourself to make mistakes, and then go back and work out how you got to those mistakes, and slowly, your understanding will grow. The huge amount of mathematics in Physics can pose a challenge to students. The fact that one wrong calculation can affect your whole conclusion when it comes to Physics problems means that it is probably not the right course for you if you’re not competent at Maths. Physics is a truly satisfying degree, once you accept that it’s going to take a while to grasp the subject. Researchers work for a decade or more in the field, and just feel like they’re scratching the surface, which is part of the beauty and frustration of this challenging subject. 4. Biomedical Science Medicine is rightfully touted as one of the hardest degrees ever, but did you know that Biomedical Science shares a lot of content with Medicine? In fact, Biomedical Science students have to understand the science of medicine in more detail than most doctors! If you were to take Biomedical Science at Imperial College London, your degree would overlap quite a lot with students taking medicine. You’ll share some modules in the first year, and then do a more research-focused second year, where you have to spend hours in labs. Your final year will then overlap with medical students’ fourth year. As Biomedical Science explores the science behind medical topics, you have to work extremely hard to understand everything from human physiology, pathology and microbiology, to haematology, cells and organs and system function. The sheer depth of knowledge means that you’ll sometimes have to learn about things you’re just not interested in (for example, learning all the names of pharmaceutical drugs!) because you need a good grade. Aside from learning and understanding highly technical, medical information, you have to do a lot of heavy, independent research as a Biomedical Science student. At Imperial College, for example, you’d complete an intensive research project of your choice, as well as massive amounts of private study to grasp lecture content. However, Biomedical Science can be a very rewarding degree, if you’re passionate about science and medicine. You’ll understand how Biomedical Science works from all angles, in research, policy and industry, as well as understand the diseases and conditions which significantly impact the human body. 5. Neuroscience Neuroscience is a fascinating degree, but it is incredibly challenging. As intricate as the human brain is, it makes perfect sense that a subject dedicated to it would be equally complex. As a multidisciplinary degree, Neuroscience involves many very difficult subjects. These include organic chemistry, psychology, mathematics, physics and cognitive science. One of these subjects alone sounds difficult enough, but having to grasp all of them in some capacity while studying neuroscience emphasises just how tough this degree subject is. If you were to take Neuroscience as a BSc at King’s College London, you’d be studying everything from aspects of cell, molecular and developmental biology, to neuroanatomy, physiology and pharmacology. Neuroscience is particularly hard to grasp because it mixes the physical and the abstract. There are so many mysteries about the human brain and consciousness that empirical science can’t entirely explain, hence why Neuroscience also includes aspects of philosophy. 6. Molecular Cell Biology Molecular Cell Biology is one of the hardest Biology degrees to study, and Biology in itself is a very challenging discipline. Studying Molecular Cell Biology is like learning a new language, as there is an incredibly complex vocabulary to describe the structure and function of life at the molecular level. Get ready to memorise a lot of names! You also need a very intricate understanding of very technical processes, including the relationship between proteins and nucleic acids, and the molecular mechanisms of immunology, genetic engineering and cancer. You’ll have to grasp very complex areas in biomedicine and biotechnology to do well at this degree. There’s often a misconception that Biology subjects don’t involve a lot of maths, but anyone who thinks that is deeply mistaken. As soon as you enter your first year of a Molecular Cell Biology degree, you’re likely to be exploring subjects like genetics, as well as things like microbiology and animal and plant biology. Genetics involves a lot of maths, as geneticists use very complex equations in their field. 7. Mathematics Most of us have had our personal rage against mathematics at school. Hence, it’s no surprise that it makes it to this list of hardest college majors. Any degree in mathematics at any level deals with a great deal of reasoning, critical thinking, formulas, and other technicalities. The courses under a mathematics major deal with either general, or pure, or applied mathematics. Some basic subjects that are covered across all the courses are algebra, differential calculus, geometry, statistics, and probability. Some of the specializations in this major are topology and foundations, analysis and functional analysis, algebra and number theory, geometric analysis, and applied mathematics. 8. Nursing Nursing is one of the most popular majors in the United States, but that’s not for its reputation as an easy degree! Nursing students spend hours working early morning and midnight shifts for their clinical, where they shadow real nurses and learn what it’s really like to be a nurse. These experiences make for some pretty intense hours. If you expect to be able to sleep in while you’re at college, a nursing degree will make that difficult! In the classroom, nursing students take classes such as anatomy, chemistry, biology, pharmacology, nutrition, and psychology. The standards are high: for many programs, you must maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA to remain in the program. Students with a love for science and helping people would thrive in a nursing program, as would students who want real-world experience while they are still in school. 9. Computer Science Computer scientists are in increasingly high demand, but you have to be ready to commit to an intense major if you want to pursue computer science! Computer science majors spend a lot of time troubleshooting and problem-solving, rather than learning a specific set of curricula that you might find in the hard sciences. Students majoring in computer science learn computational methods while also learning the theory and application of computers, from informatics to systems. Typical coursework for a computer science major includes algorithms, discrete structures, and computer architecture. This is in addition to programming courses that cover many languages – C, C++, Python, Java, and many more (depending on your program). Those who love tinkering with computers and who love a challenge might find a good match in studying computer science. 10. Statistics Statistics is a more complicated course than most people imagine it to be. This is true, the level of difficulty of this course could be understood only if you enrol for the course and start learning it. The collection of an extensive amount of data in tables itself is complex in nature. This is true, have you tried to understand the course, it is very complicated. The course demands strong memory power, an extensive number of formulas, theories, tests, etc. All of these together make statistics a difficult course. The argument about which college major is the hardest and which is the easiest to complete is highly subjective even though an objective view exists. You’ll have to concentrate on other criteria like passion towards a field and employment outlook when selecting a major, rather than the difficulty level. This is because, contrary to popular opinion, the easier a major doesn’t necessarily mean you will not study hard to pass.  © 2023 AFTER SCHOOL AFRICA Be the first to know about latest funding opportunities Learn what past funding-winners know that most people don’t.

                    Please analyze the following article for tone, accuracy, bias, and motivation, then summarize into a no more than 50 word response: When you’re choosing your college classes, you’re probably looking for a bit of a challenge — but maybe not a bunch of classes that keep you up late studying until dawn. How do you strike a balance between difficult and approachable when you don’t know what you’re getting yourself into?   While every college is unique, there are some courses that have similar reputations across institutions. So, what are the hardest college classes, and which are the easiest?          Of course, you don’t have complete control over your schedule. You’ll need to complete certain requirements for your major. Be sure you’re aware of these courses, and draw up a plan to spread them out over your four years. See our post of the easiest and hardest majors to learn more about what sort of course load to expect.     Similarly, many schools have general education requirements that all students must complete. If you’re lucky, you’ll have some choice within these requirements, but that’s not always the case. Be sure to map these out too, as you don’t want to end up needing to take a bunch of these at once just to graduate on time.     Some courses might be necessary for getting into graduate school or pursuing a career in a certain field. This is especially true for aspiring healthcare professionals, from doctors to physical therapists to pharmacists. Make sure you read up on what you’ll need to do when you’re planning your course schedule.     Think about your on- and off-campus commitments, not just in terms of when the courses take place (although that should certainly be a factor), but also in terms of your workload, and whether your schedule will accommodate it. Also be totally honest with yourself about whether you can get up for that 9AM class!     You may not always have the intel when it comes to who’s teaching what — especially in the case of introductory classes — but if you can learn anything about the instructor’s reputation, that may help inform you about which classes to take. Be sure to ask fellow students who have taken the course or had the instructor before. You can also look up professor reviews on ratemyprofessors.com.     To create this list, we took into account:     It’s important to remember that courses may be more or less challenging depending on the school and instructor — no two are identical. Bear in mind, too, that some subjects come more easily to certain people than others. Just as quantum physics might be a breeze for a math- and science-minded student, that same student might find the writing in film studies challenging. Our free chancing engine takes into account your history, background, test scores, and extracurricular activities to show you your real chances of admission—and how to improve them.     The notorious requirement for pre-meds is known for separating the future doctors from those who might not make the cut. Not only are the stakes extremely high, but the coursework itself is grueling, and students often study incorrectly for it. Many students think that Orgo is about memorization, when it’s actually a pattern recognition logic class. Students need to understand how molecules react and how to combine simple molecular building blocks into more complicated drugs and compounds. Instead of cramming their heads with information that they don’t truly understand, students should try to treat Orgo as a math class and do lots of practice problems.      Interpreting the theories of some of the greatest thinkers of all time is a challenging task. From Kant to Nietzsche, Plato to Confucius, there’s a lot to unpack and think about. Many of the works are quite dense and difficult to read, not to mention write about (be prepared to read and write a LOT). Arguably one of the hardest parts of the course are the questions and hypothetical scenarios with no clear “good” answer (trolley problem, anyone?).      Studying the structure and origins of language is no walk in the park, even for the language-lovers among us. Linguistics can be surprisingly analytical and scientific. There are many subcategories within this larger field, including the study of speech sounds, word structure, language sound systems, language meaning, and the arrangement of words. Students will ponder questions such as “What defines different accents?,” “How do we know what certain words mean?”and “How can we program a computer to analyze sentence structure?”. You should also be prepared to learn and apply the International Phonetic Alphabet.      If the very mention of this course strikes fear in your heart, you’re not alone. This course is extremely difficult for many students because of how abstract it is, and the level of math required. Students often struggle because they don’t have the underlying math background (it’s recommended that you’ve taken at least multivariable calculus, and linear algebra and differential equations are also very helpful). And even if you do understand the math involved in this course, it’s often challenging to apply or interpret the math in abstract quantum systems.      This course is a requirement for some health professions, like physical therapy and nursing (surprisingly, it’s not often required by medical schools, but is for physician assistant programs). Anatomy and Physiology is tough because it involves a lot of memorization. You’ll need to know tons of anatomical jargon, and understand the complex functions of different parts of the human body. It can be easy to start mixing all the terms up. That being said, it can also be really fascinating to understand how each part of our body works individually, and how they work together as a whole.        In high school, you might have dreaded PE, but don’t worry: college PE doesn’t resemble that stuff of your nightmares in the least. If you have this requirement at your college, you’ll probably be able to choose from fun activities like yoga, archery, rowing, and many more.     If you appreciate music, well, this is the class for you! You’ll learn about the inner workings of compositions, delve into the history and makeups of different genres, and more. If you’re lucky, the course may even involve field trips to see performers.     Not only is this course one of the easier ones you’ll likely face during your college career, but it’s also highly practical — managing your money is an important skill everyone should have. From paying off student loans to saving for retirement, you’ll start developing good financial habits early on.     Since psychology is the study of human behavior, it’s often interesting and relevant. The course is highly concept-based, and once you understand the theories behind certain behaviors, you can apply and recognize it easily; this makes exams fairly straightforward. Since the content is also so applicable to our daily lives, it’s easier to understand than abstract subjects like math or physics. Most fundamental psychology courses fall under this umbrella, such as social psych, developmental psych, and abnormal psych.     Who doesn’t love movies? This course will teach you to grapple with the content in a new way. You’ll explore film theory, analyze movies, and learn the technical side of filmmaking. Along with watching films and producing your own, these courses tend to involve much discussion, research, and writing. It’s a great fit for those who love the analytical side of the humanities, but also want to exercise their creativity. While this course might not be one of the hardest, expect to put in ample hours watching films, shooting footage, and editing your work.    Curious about your chances of acceptance to your dream school?
